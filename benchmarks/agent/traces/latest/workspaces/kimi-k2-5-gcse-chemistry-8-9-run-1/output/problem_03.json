  "method": "Step 1: Calculate moles of NaOH used. n(NaOH) = c × V = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.150 × 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol (using c from L39 and V from L39). Step 2: Use reaction stoichiometry from L40 (H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O) which shows 1:2 mole ratio between H2SO4 and NaOH. Therefore n(H2SO4) = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Step 3: Calculate concentration of H2SO4 using c = n / V with V = 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3 from L39. c(H2SO4) = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Magnitude check: Stronger acid (diprotic) should have lower concentration than NaOH for same neutralization volume ratio, which matches (0.0702 < 0.150)."
