  "method": "First calculate moles of NaOH: n = c × V = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio is 1:2, so moles of H2SO4 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Calculate concentration of H2SO4: c = n/V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3. The 1:2 stoichiometry means the acid concentration is half what it would be for a 1:1 reaction.",

    "Unit consistency: cm3 converted to dm3 consistently - verified"
