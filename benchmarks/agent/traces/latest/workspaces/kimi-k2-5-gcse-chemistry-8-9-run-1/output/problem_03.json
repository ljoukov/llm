  "method": "First calculate moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = c × V = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the reaction stoichiometry H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio is 1:2 (acid:base). Therefore, moles of H2SO4 = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate concentration of H2SO4: c = n/V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

  "checks": [
    "Sulfuric acid is diprotic, so half the moles of acid compared to base expected",
    "Volume conversion correct: cm3 to dm3 by dividing by 1000",
    "Concentration of acid lower than base (0.0702 vs 0.150) consistent with smaller volume and diprotic nature"
