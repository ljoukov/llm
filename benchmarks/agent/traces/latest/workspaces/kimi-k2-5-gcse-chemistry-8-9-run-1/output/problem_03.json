  "method": "First convert the volume of NaOH to dm3: 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3. Calculate moles of NaOH using n = c × V: 0.150 mol dm-3 × 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Therefore moles of H2SO4 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Convert acid volume to dm3: 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3. Calculate concentration of H2SO4: c = n/V = 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
