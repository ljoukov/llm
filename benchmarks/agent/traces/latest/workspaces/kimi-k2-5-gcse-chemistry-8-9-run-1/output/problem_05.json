  "method": "First convert time to seconds: 30.0 min × 60 s/min = 1800 s. Calculate charge Q using Q = I × t: Q = 1.50 A × 1800 s = 2700 C. Calculate moles of electrons using n(e-) = Q / F: n(e-) = 2700 C / 96500 C mol-1 = 0.02798 mol. From the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, 2 moles of electrons produce 1 mole of copper. Therefore n(Cu) = 0.02798 / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Calculate mass of copper using m = n × Ar: m(Cu) = 0.01399 mol × 63.55 g/mol = 0.889 g.",
