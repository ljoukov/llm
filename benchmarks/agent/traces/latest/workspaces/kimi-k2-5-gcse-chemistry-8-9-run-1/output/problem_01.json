  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 is the initial concentration, V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume. Rearranging for c2: c2 = c1V1/V2. Substituting values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 × 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. Note that since both volumes are in cm3, the units cancel and no unit conversion is needed.",
