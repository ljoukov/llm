  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 (initial concentration from L29), V1 = 25.0 cm3 (initial volume from L29), and V2 = 250.0 cm3 (final volume from L29). Rearranging: c2 = c1V1 / V2. Substituting values: c2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The answer is 0.02 mol dm-3 when expressed to 2 decimal places or 0.0200 mol dm-3 to 3 significant figures.",
