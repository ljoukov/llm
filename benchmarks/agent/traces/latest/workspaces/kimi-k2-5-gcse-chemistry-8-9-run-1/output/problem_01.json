  },
  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3, V1 = 25.0 cm3, and V2 = 250.0 cm3. Rearranging for c2 gives c2 = c1V1/V2. Substituting values: c2 = 0.200 × 25.0 / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. Since V1 and V2 share the same units (cm3), no unit conversion is needed. The answer is reported to 3 significant figures to match the precision of the input data.",

    "Magnitude check: dilution increases volume 10-fold, concentration decreases 10-fold - reasonable"
