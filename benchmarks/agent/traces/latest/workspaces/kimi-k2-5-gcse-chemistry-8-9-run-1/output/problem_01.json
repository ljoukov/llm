  },
  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 is the initial concentration (0.200 mol dm-3), V1 is the initial volume (25.0 cm3), and V2 is the final volume (250.0 cm3). The final concentration c2 is calculated as (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. Since all input values have 3 significant figures, the answer is reported to 3 significant figures.",
