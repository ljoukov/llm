  },
  "method": "Using the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). For the reaction CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O: Bonds broken are 4 C-H bonds and 2 O=O bonds. Sum of bonds broken = 4(413) + 2(498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed are 2 C=O bonds (in CO2) and 4 O-H bonds. Sum of bonds formed = 2(805) + 4(463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. Therefore deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1, which rounds to -820 kJ mol-1 when using the bond energy precision provided.",
