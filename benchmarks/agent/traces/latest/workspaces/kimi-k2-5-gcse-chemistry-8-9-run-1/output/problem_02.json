  "method": "First calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Then calculate moles of CaCO3 using n = m/Mr: 4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.04196 mol. From the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the mole ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1. Therefore moles of CO2 produced = 0.04196 mol. Finally, calculate mass of CO2: 0.04196 mol × 44.0 g/mol = 1.846 g, rounded to 1.85 g to 3 significant figures.",
