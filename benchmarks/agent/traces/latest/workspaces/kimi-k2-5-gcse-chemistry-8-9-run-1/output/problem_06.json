  "method": "Step 1: Calculate equilibrium concentrations from the given mole amounts and vessel volume. From L56, vessel volume = 2.00 dm3. From L57, moles(NO2) = 0.180 mol. From L58, moles(N2O4) = 0.220 mol. Step 2: Calculate concentrations using c = n / V. [NO2] = 0.180 / 2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 / 2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Step 3: Calculate Kc using the expression from L20: Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.073636... = 0.0736 to 3 s.f. Note: L21 confirms Kc should be reported as dimensionless (unitless).",

    "Physical sense: Kc < 1 indicates equilibrium lies toward reactants (N2O4), consistent with more moles of N2O4 than NO2 at equilibrium."
