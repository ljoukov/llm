  "method": "Calculate equilibrium concentrations by dividing moles by volume (2.00 dm3). [NO2] = 0.180 / 2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 / 2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Apply the equilibrium constant expression Kc = [NO2]² / [N2O4]. Substituting values: Kc = (0.0900)² / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The value is reported as dimensionless (unitless) as specified in the constants section.",
