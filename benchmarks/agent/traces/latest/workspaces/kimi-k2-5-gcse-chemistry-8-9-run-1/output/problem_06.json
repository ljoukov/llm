  "method": "First calculate equilibrium concentrations. For NO2: [NO2] = n/V = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. For N2O4: [N2O4] = n/V = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Using the equilibrium expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.073636..., which rounds to 0.0736 to 3 significant figures. As specified, Kc is reported as dimensionless (unitless).",

    "Both concentrations calculated correctly by dividing moles by volume in dm3",
    "Kc expression correctly uses [NO2]^2 in numerator for 2 NO2 products",
    "Numerator smaller than denominator gives Kc < 1, indicating reactant-favored equilibrium",
    "Result reported as dimensionless as required by specification"
