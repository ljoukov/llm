In their model comparisons, a perfectly airless ‘bare rock’ struggles to explain both the size of the phase variation and the observed spectral structure at the same time, while atmosphere-bearing models fit the combined data better. The results therefore argue against a strictly airless interpretation, but they do not uniquely determine what the atmosphere is made of or how thick it is, because different assumptions about composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation can produce similar signals.
