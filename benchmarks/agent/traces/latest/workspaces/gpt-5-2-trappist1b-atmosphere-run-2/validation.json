The study analyzed JWST MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy taken across an orbital phase curve to see how the planet’s thermal emission changes with phase and whether the spectrum shows atmospheric absorption. The authors report a dayside brightness temperature of 342 +/- 22 K and retrieve a non-zero heat transport efficiency (epsilon) of 0.19 (+0.23 / -0.14), which favors some redistribution of heat from day to night compared with the perfect no-atmosphere limit.

In the joint fit, atmosphere-bearing models are preferred over a no-atmosphere model (likelihood ratio 7.4 versus a 1.0 baseline).
