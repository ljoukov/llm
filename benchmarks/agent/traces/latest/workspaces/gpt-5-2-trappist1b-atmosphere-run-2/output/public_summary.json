  "headline": "JWST phase-curve data hint TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized rocky planet that likely keeps the same face toward its star, so one side is in constant day and the other in constant night. The study analyzed JWST MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy taken across an orbital phase curve to see how the planet’s thermal emission changes with phase and whether the spectrum shows atmospheric absorption. The authors report a dayside brightness temperature of 342 +/- 22 K and retrieve a non-zero heat transport efficiency (epsilon) of 0.19 (+0.23 / -0.14), which favors some redistribution of heat from day to night compared with the perfect no-atmosphere limit. They also report spectral structure around the 15 um CO2 band (a band depth estimate of 96 ppm) that is consistent with atmospheric absorption. In the joint fit, atmosphere-bearing models are preferred over a no-atmosphere model (likelihood ratio 7.4 versus a 1.0 baseline). At the same time, the authors stress that atmospheric composition and pressure are still uncertain, that O2-rich cases are not fully ruled out, and that degeneracies and possible systematics mean follow-up spectroscopy is needed.",
