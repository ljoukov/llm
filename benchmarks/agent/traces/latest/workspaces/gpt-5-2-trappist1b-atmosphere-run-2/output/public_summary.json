  "headline": "JWST phase-curve data hint that TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a hot, Earth-sized rocky planet that likely always shows the same face to its star. The study analyzed JWST MIRI observations taken across a full orbit, measuring how the planet’s thermal emission changes with orbital phase (a ‘phase curve’) and whether the spectrum shows a feature near the 15 um carbon-dioxide (CO2) band. In their model comparisons, a perfectly airless ‘bare rock’ struggles to explain both the size of the phase variation and the observed spectral structure at the same time, while atmosphere-bearing models fit the combined data better. The results therefore argue against a strictly airless interpretation, but they do not uniquely determine what the atmosphere is made of or how thick it is, because different assumptions about composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation can produce similar signals. Follow-up observations are needed to confirm the feature and narrow down the atmosphere’s properties.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Uses JWST MIRI phase-curve spectroscopy to test whether TRAPPIST-1 b is airless or atmosphere-bearing.",
    "Finds evidence for non-zero day-night heat redistribution rather than the strict no-atmosphere limit.",
    "Reports spectral structure near the 15 um CO2 band that is consistent with atmospheric absorption."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The work is based on a single planet, so it cannot be generalized to all rocky planets around M dwarfs.",
    "Atmospheric retrievals can be sensitive to assumptions about circulation, clouds/hazes, and prior choices.",
    "Weak spectral features may be affected by stellar variability and instrument systematics.",
    "Night-side emission is less well constrained than day-side emission in the current dataset."
