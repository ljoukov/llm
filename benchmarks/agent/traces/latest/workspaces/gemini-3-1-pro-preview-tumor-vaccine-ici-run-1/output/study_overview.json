    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized; residual confounding is likely.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients.",

    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumors.",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems rather than uniformly."
