In preclinical mouse models, the combination of intratumoral mRNA vaccination and anti-PD-L1 therapy improved tumor control and increased immune cell infiltration. Notably, vaccine-only treatments did not yield durable tumor control in non-immunogenic models, and ICI-only treatments had limited activity without the vaccine. The mRNA vaccine induced an interferon-driven inflammatory state that increased the presentation of tumor proteins on the cell surface, making the tumors more visible to the immune system. A retrospective study of 130 human patients with metastatic cancer showed an association between prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and improved survival under ICI treatment.
