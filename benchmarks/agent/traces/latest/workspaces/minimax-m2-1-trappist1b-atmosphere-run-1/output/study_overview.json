  "major_limitations": [
    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system or beyond.",
    "Retrieval assumptions regarding circulation patterns, opacity priors, and cloud treatment significantly affect quantitative posterior estimates and should be interpreted with appropriate uncertainty margins.",
    "Stellar variability from the active M dwarf host and potential instrument systematics could bias detection of weak spectral features near the detection threshold.",
    "Night-side constraints are substantially weaker than day-side constraints in the current dataset, limiting complete characterization of day-night heat transport."
