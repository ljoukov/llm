  "major_limitations": [
    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets.",
    "Retrieval assumptions including circulation models, opacity priors, and cloud treatment affect quantitative posteriors and could bias results.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics can bias weak spectral features, introducing uncertainty into the detection claims.",
    "Night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints in the current dataset due to observational geometry.",
    "Degeneracies between atmospheric composition, cloud/haze properties, and circulation assumptions remain significant and limit compositional constraints."
