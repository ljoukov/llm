    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets.",
    "Retrieval assumptions including circulation models, opacity priors, and cloud treatment affect quantitative posteriors and conclusions.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics can bias weak spectral features and introduce uncertainties in atmospheric detections.",
    "Night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints in the current JWST MIRI dataset, limiting complete atmospheric characterization."
