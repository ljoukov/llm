The study examined how the planet's temperature changes as it circles its host star - a phenomenon called a phase curve - and looked for spectral signatures that would indicate the presence of atmospheric gases. The researchers found that the planet shows evidence of heat being transported from its permanently sunlit day side to its dark night side in a way that cannot be explained by a bare rock but is consistent with atmospheric circulation. Additionally, subtle spectral features around 15 micrometers suggest the presence of carbon dioxide or similar greenhouse gases. While the evidence for an atmosphere is statistically significant, the study also reveals that the exact composition and thickness of the atmosphere remain uncertain, and alternative interpretations including oxidized atmospheres or different cloud properties could also explain the data.
