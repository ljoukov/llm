        "output/claim_audit.json is explicitly flagged as groundingValid=false, and multiple “quotes” are not present verbatim in the report (e.g., “Joint fit likelihood ratio (atmosphere vs no atmosphere) = 7.4” vs the table entry at L31; similarly for epsilon at L28, CO2 band depth at L30, pressure scale at L32). This breaks the requirement that line references and quoted evidence map validly to the numbered report lines.",
        "output/public_summary.json contains fabricated or unsupported contextual claims not in the report, including “about 40 light-years away” (not stated anywhere in L1–L54) and broader implication statements about “habitability” and “contradicting simple predictions that such planets should lose their atmospheres” (not supported by the provided report text). This violates the “no fabricated claims” criterion even if not strictly quantitative.",
        "output/public_summary.json overstates evidence strength in several places relative to the report’s calibrated language: headline says “strongest evidence yet” (not supported in L1–L54); “compelling evidence … possesses an atmosphere” is stronger than the report’s “meaningful evidence against a strictly airless interpretation” and “composition and pressure remain uncertain” (L52–L53).",
        "public_summary ‘what_is_new’ includes an overclaim: “epsilon = 0.19 … would be impossible on an airless world.” The report only states non-zero redistribution is favored (L28) and interprets it as implying transport beyond bare-rock reradiation limit (L41), but does not justify the absolute statement “impossible.” Given the uncertainty range in L28 includes values closer to zero, the categorical claim is not calibrated.",
        "output/claim_audit.json assigns ‘strength’: “strong” to claims that are at most moderate per the report’s caveats and uncertainties (e.g., C02 about epsilon, despite L28 uncertainty and L37/L48 about degeneracies; C04 about likelihood ratio despite caveats and model dependence at L48–L49). This fails the calibration requirement.",
        "public_summary implies both CO2-rich or O2-rich atmospheres with “moderate pressure.” The report provides a preferred pressure scale specifically “in CO2-rich retrieval family” (L32) and separately notes O2-rich cases are not ruled out (L36), but does not state O2-rich scenarios have moderate pressure. This is a conflation/misinterpretation."

      "summary": "The study_overview.json and quantitative_findings.json largely track the report’s structure and numeric values with correct line refs (e.g., L27–L32, L35–L37). However, the full output set fails strict grading because claim_audit.json uses non-verbatim ‘quotes’ that do not match the report lines (grounding invalid), and public_summary.json adds unsupported details (e.g., distance) and overstates certainty (e.g., ‘strongest evidence yet’, ‘impossible on an airless world’, moderate-pressure O2).这些"
