        "Unsupported (hallucinated) factual claims in public_summary.json that are not present anywhere in the report lines: (a) “a Rocky Planet 40 Light-Years Away” and repeated “40 light-years” (no distance given in report); (b) “orbits every 1.5 days” (orbital period not stated in report); (c) “best evidence yet” (comparative superlative not supported by report text); (d) “First JWST MIRI phase-curve study specifically targeting TRAPPIST-1 b” (novelty/priority claim not in report). These violate the no-fabrication and calibration requirements.",
        "Overstatement / miscalibration in claim_audit.json: Claim C04 says the bare-rock model is “ruled out.” The report states the pure no-atmosphere model “cannot simultaneously match” key observables (L35) and that evidence is “against a strictly airless interpretation” with uncertainties remaining (L53). That is closer to “disfavored” than “ruled out.”",
        "Further overstatement risk in claim_audit.json: Claim C06 is labeled strength “strong,” but the report’s takeaway is explicitly cautious (L53) and emphasizes remaining degeneracies and need for follow-up (L44, L53). Assigning “strong” is not well-calibrated to the report’s framing.",

While framed as questions, they introduce unsupported themes that reduce downstream scientific review usefulness and can mislead scope."
