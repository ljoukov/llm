  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH used in titration: moles(NaOH) = concentration × volume in dm3 = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the stoichiometric ratio shows 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of H2SO4, so moles(H2SO4) = moles(NaOH) / 2 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Calculate concentration of H2SO4: concentration = moles / volume in dm3 = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
