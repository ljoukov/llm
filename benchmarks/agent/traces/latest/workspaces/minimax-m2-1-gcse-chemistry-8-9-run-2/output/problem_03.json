  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = concentration × volume in dm3 = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.003510 mol. From the balanced reaction H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the stoichiometry shows 2 mol NaOH react with 1 mol H2SO4. Calculate moles of H2SO4: n(H2SO4) = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.003510 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Calculate concentration of H2SO4: c(H2SO4) = n(H2SO4) / volume in dm3 = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Double the moles of NaOH (0.003510) to match H2SO4 stoichiometry gives 0.001755 mol H2SO4, which when divided by 0.02500 dm3 yields 0.0702 mol dm-3",
    "Concentration of acid (0.0702 mol dm-3) is approximately half the concentration of base (0.150 mol dm-3), consistent with the 1:2 acid-base stoichiometry"
