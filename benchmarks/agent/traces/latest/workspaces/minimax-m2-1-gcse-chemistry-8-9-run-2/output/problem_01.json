  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, where initial concentration c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 and initial volume V1 = 25.0 cm3 are transferred to a final volume V2 = 250.0 cm3. Convert volumes to consistent units if needed (cm3 to dm3 maintains 1:1 ratio), then rearrange to solve for c2: c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. This represents a 10-fold dilution as expected from the 25.0 to 250.0 volume ratio.",
