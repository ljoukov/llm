    "value": 0.0200,

    "precision_note": "Using dilution formula with three significant figures from 25.0 and 250.0 cm3 volumes gives four sf result, reported to three sf as per standard practice"
  },
  "method": "Apply the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2 where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3, V1 = 25.0 cm3, and V2 = 250.0 cm3. Convert volumes using consistent units or work directly with the ratio since the formula requires consistent units. Calculate c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.0 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The dilution factor is 10-fold (250/25), so concentration decreases by factor of 10 from 0.200 to 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "Volume ratio of 250/25 = 10 indicates 10-fold dilution, confirming c2 should be 1/10 of c1",
    "0.0200 is exactly 0.200 divided by 10, confirming the calculation"
