  "method": "Calculate energy required to break bonds in reactants CH4 + 2O2: Breaking 4 C-H bonds requires 4 × 413 = 1652 kJ, and breaking 2 O=O bonds requires 2 × 498 = 996 kJ, so total energy absorbed (bonds broken) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ. Calculate energy released when bonds form in products CO2 + 2H2O: Forming 2 C=O bonds releases 2 × 805 = 1610 kJ, and forming 4 O-H bonds releases 4 × 463 = 1852 kJ, so total energy released (bonds formed) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ. Calculate enthalpy change: ΔH = energy absorbed - energy released = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative value confirms the reaction is exothermic.",
