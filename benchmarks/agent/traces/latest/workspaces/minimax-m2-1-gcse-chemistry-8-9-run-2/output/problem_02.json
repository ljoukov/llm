  "method": "First calculate the mass of CaCO3 in the sample using percentage purity: mass(CaCO3) = 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Then calculate moles of CaCO3 using molar mass: moles(CaCO3) = mass / Mr = 4.20 / 100.1 = 0.04196 mol. From the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the stoichiometric ratio between CaCO3 and CO2 is 1:1, so moles(CO2) = 0.04196 mol. Finally calculate mass of CO2 using molar mass: mass(CO2) = moles × Mr = 0.04196 × 44.0 = 1.846 g, rounded to 1.85 g.",
