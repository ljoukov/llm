  "method": "Calculate total charge passed through the solution: Q = current × time = 1.50 A × (30.0 min × 60 s/min) = 1.50 × 1800 = 2700 C. Calculate moles of electrons using Faraday constant: moles(e-) = Q / F = 2700 / 96500 = 0.02798 mol. From the cathode half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, 2 moles of electrons produce 1 mole of Cu, so moles(Cu) = moles(e-) / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Calculate mass of copper deposited: mass = moles × atomic mass = 0.01399 × 63.55 = 0.889 g.",
