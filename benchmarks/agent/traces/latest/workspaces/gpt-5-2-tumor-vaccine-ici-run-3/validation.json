This study reports that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors can create an interferon-driven inflammatory state that helps the immune system recognize the tumor and may make checkpoint blockade more effective. In mouse tumor models, the combination of intratumoral mRNA vaccination and anti-PD-L1 is described as improving tumor control, alongside signs of increased immune activity within the tumor. The report also summarizes a retrospective (non-randomized) analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors, where those with prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (43 patients) had better survival than unvaccinated patients (87 patients), with a reported p-value of 0.01.
