This study tested whether delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor could create a local, interferon-rich inflammatory state that helps the immune system recognize the tumor and respond better to anti-PD-L1 therapy. In mouse tumor models, the report summarizes evidence for increased immune activation after intratumoral mRNA vaccination, including a broader peptide repertoire presented on MHC-I and higher intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density, alongside increased PD-L1 expression (which can make PD-L1 blockade more relevant). The paper also includes a retrospective, non-randomized analysis of metastatic patients treated with ICIs (130 total), comparing outcomes by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status (43 vaccinated vs 87 unvaccinated). In that retrospective comparison, the vaccinated subgroup had improved survival under ICI treatment with a reported p-value of 0.01.
