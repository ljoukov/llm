  "headline": "JWST finds hints of an atmosphere on the rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a rocky planet similar in size to Earth, orbiting a small, cool star. Scientists have long wondered if this planet, which is very close to its star and likely has one side always facing it, could hold onto an atmosphere. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a team of astronomers observed the planet's heat as it orbited its star. They found that heat is being moved from the permanent 'day' side to the 'night' side, which suggests an atmosphere is present to circulate the heat. The data also shows a possible signature of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. While this is a promising sign of an atmosphere, more observations are needed to be sure about what it's made of and how thick it is.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "For the first time, the JWST has been used to measure the thermal phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.",
    "The data suggests that there is some heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside of the planet, which is a sign of a possible atmosphere.",
    "A spectral feature consistent with carbon dioxide absorption has been tentatively detected in the planet's atmosphere."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The evidence for an atmosphere is still tentative and based on a single set of observations.",
    "The models used to interpret the data have several assumptions that could affect the conclusions.",
    "Other explanations for the observations, such as stellar variability or a very thin, different type of atmosphere, cannot be completely ruled out yet."
