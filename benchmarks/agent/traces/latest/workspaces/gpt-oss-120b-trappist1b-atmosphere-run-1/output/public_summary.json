  "headline": "JWST phase‑curve data reveal likely atmospheric presence on the rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST‑1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "The James Webb Space Telescope measured the changing infrared glow of the Earth‑sized planet TRAPPIST‑1 b as it orbits its nearby red dwarf star. By analysing the day‑side temperature, how heat is moved to the night side, and a subtle carbon‑dioxide spectral fingerprint, the authors find several pieces of evidence that the planet is not a barren rock but likely holds an atmosphere. The preferred models suggest a modest pressure (about 0.3‑1 bar) and a very dark surface (low albedo). However, the conclusions rely on complex atmospheric retrievals, and alternative explanations involving clouds, composition, or instrumental effects cannot be fully excluded. Further observations at other wavelengths are needed to confirm the atmospheric composition and pressure.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Joint analysis of JWST MIRI phase‑curve thermal spectra and the 15 µm CO₂ band provides the first combined thermal and compositional evidence for an atmosphere on TRAPPIST‑1 b.",
    "The retrieved heat‑transport efficiency (ε≈0.19) is significantly non‑zero, indicating atmospheric circulation that redistributes heat from the day side to the night side.",
    "A pressure range of 0.3‑1.0 bar for a CO₂‑rich atmosphere is compatible with the data, marking the first quantitative pressure estimate for this planet."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The study analyses only a single planet, so the results cannot be generalized to other rocky worlds around M‑dwarf stars.",
    "Atmospheric retrievals depend on assumptions about circulation, clouds, and opacity priors, which can bias the inferred temperature, pressure and composition.",
    "Stellar variability and JWST instrument systematics may affect the weak 15 µm CO₂ feature, potentially mimicking or obscuring real atmospheric signals."
