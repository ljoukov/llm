  "major_limitations": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized; residual confounding is likely and prevents definitive causal conclusions.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients, introducing heterogeneity that may affect outcome comparisons.",
    "Tumor-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity across the patient cohort limit direct causal interpretation of results.",
    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumors due to species differences in immune biology.",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems rather than uniformly across all tested settings."
