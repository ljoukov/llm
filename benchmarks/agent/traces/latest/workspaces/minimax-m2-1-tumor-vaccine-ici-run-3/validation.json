        "Invalid / non-mapping line references: claim_audit.json uses a line_ref of \"L21-L23\", which does not match the required single-line pattern and was flagged by validation (report lines are individually numbered; ranges are not valid per the checker). This breaks the requirement that line references are valid and mappable to the report.",
        "Grounding/schema failures reduce downstream usability: claim_audit.json and public_summary.json are explicitly marked schemaValid:false and groundingValid:false. Even if content were mostly accurate, these outputs are not reliably ingestible for automated review pipelines.",
        "Fabricated/derived quantitative claim not stated in report: quantitative_findings.json Q01 interpretation adds \"a 25 percentage point increase\". While arithmetically derived from L28 (62.3% vs 37.3%), it is still a new quantitative statement not explicitly reported in the source table and violates the 'no fabricated quantitative claims' criterion under strict grading.",
        "Overstatement beyond report wording: public_summary.json says the study 'transform[s] cold, non-immunogenic tumors into inflamed environments that respond better to immune checkpoint therapy.' The report supports induction of an interferon-rich state and sensitization in mice (L10-L16, L41-L46), but the 'transform cold tumors' framing is stronger and more general than the report’s calibrated caveats (L52-L53) and the conditional/limited monotherapy effects (L36-L37).",
        "Some mechanistic-to-efficacy linkage is not properly supported with cited evidence: claim_audit.json C03 asserts 'superior tumor control compared to either monotherapy' but cites PD-L1 upregulation (L32) and CD8 density (L33), which are mechanistic/correlative readouts rather than direct tumor control endpoints in the provided report lines. The report does state improved tumor control in mice in narrative form (L46) and monotherapy limitations (L36-L37), but the claim’s cited evidence does not directly substantiate the comparative efficacy statement."

However, the overall submission fails strict grading because two files are invalid/ungrounded per the provided validation flags, line references are not consistently valid (notably the \"L21-L23\" range), and at least one quantitative interpretation introduces a derived number not present in the report (\"25 percentage point increase\").
