This study explored whether injecting mRNA vaccines—similar to those used for COVID-19—directly into tumors could make them more responsive to ICI therapy. The researchers found that in mice, this approach triggered a strong immune response, specifically increasing 'type I interferon' signaling. This signal helped tumors display more of their proteins to the immune system, making them easier to spot and attack. In mouse models, the combination of the vaccine and ICI therapy controlled tumors better than either treatment alone. The study also looked back at data from human patients with metastatic cancer and found that those who had received an mRNA vaccine had better survival rates when treated with ICIs.
