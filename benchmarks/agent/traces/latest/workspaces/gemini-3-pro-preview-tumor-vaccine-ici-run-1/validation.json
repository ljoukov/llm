Some cancers are resistant to current immunotherapies, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), because the immune system cannot 'see' them well. The researchers tested if injecting an mRNA vaccine (like the ones used for COVID-19) directly into tumors could change this. They found that in mice, this vaccination triggered a strong 'alarm' signal (interferon response) inside the tumor. This signal caused the tumor cells to show more of their proteins on their surface, making them easier for immune cells to spot and attack. When combined with ICI therapy, the treatment worked much better than ICI alone. The researchers also looked at past data from human cancer patients and found that those who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine seemed to respond better to ICI treatment.
