  "plain_language_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that help the immune system fight cancer, but they do not work for everyone. This study explored whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors could make them more responsive to these drugs. Using mouse models, the researchers found that the vaccine triggered an inflammatory response similar to a viral infection, making the cancer cells more visible to the immune system. This 'red flag' effect involved the release of type I interferons and an increase in proteins that T cells recognize. When combined with checkpoint inhibitor therapy, the vaccine significantly improved tumor control in mice compared to either treatment alone. Additionally, a look back at human patient data suggested that those who had received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines might have had better survival outcomes when treated with checkpoint inhibitors, although this part of the study was not a controlled trial. These findings suggest a promising new strategy for boosting cancer immunotherapy, but more research is needed to confirm if it works safely and effectively in humans.",
