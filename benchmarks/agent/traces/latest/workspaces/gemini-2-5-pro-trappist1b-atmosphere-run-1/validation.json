Confirmation language risks overstating uncertainty about the atmosphere signal itself."

However, the overall submission fails because the public_summary output is explicitly not schema-valid and not grounding-valid, and it introduces at least one unsupported claim about being the 'first' JWST phase-curve spectroscopy for TRAPPIST-1 b (not present in the report).
