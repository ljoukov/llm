    "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized planet orbiting a nearby star. Scientists used the James Webb Space Telescope to study its temperature over a full orbit, creating a 'phase curve.' They found that the planet's dark side is warmer than it would be if it had no atmosphere, suggesting heat is being transported from the hot day side. They also saw a dip in the planet's light that could be caused by carbon dioxide, a key ingredient for a greenhouse effect. While these signs point away from a bare-rock world, the evidence isn't conclusive yet. More observations are needed to confirm if TRAPPIST-1 b has an atmosphere and what it's made of.",
