  "method": "The charge passed during electrolysis was calculated using Q = I \times t, with current I = 1.50 A (L51) and time t = 30.0 min = 1800 s, giving Q = 2700 C. The number of moles of electrons was obtained from n(e-) = Q / F, using the Faraday constant F = 96,500 C mol-1 (L19), yielding n(e-) = 2.7985 \times 10^-2 mol. Each copper atom requires two electrons (half‑reaction Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, L52), so moles of Cu deposited are n(Cu) = n(e-) / 2 = 1.3993 \times 10^-2 mol. Multiplying by the molar mass of copper, Mr(Cu) = 63.55 g mol-1 (L25), gives the mass of copper deposited: m = 0.888 g. All intermediate results were retained to three‑significant‑figure precision as dictated by the source data.",
