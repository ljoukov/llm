  "method": "The reaction CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O involves breaking four C‑H bonds (4 × 413 kJ mol‑1) and two O=O bonds (2 × 498 kJ mol‑1). Forming two C=O bonds in CO2 (2 × 805 kJ mol‑1) and four O‑H bonds in water (4 × 463 kJ mol‑1) releases energy. Applying ΔH = Σ(broken) – Σ(formed) gives ΔH = (4·413 + 2·498) – (2·805 + 4·463) = 2648 – 3462 = –814 kJ mol‑1. All bond‑energy values are taken directly from the report, and the calculation retains three‑significant‑figure precision throughout.",
