  "method": "Moles of NaOH were calculated using c = n/V with the given concentration (0.150 mol dm-3) and volume (23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3). Using the 2:1 stoichiometry of NaOH to H2SO4, the moles of H2SO4 were obtained by halving the NaOH moles. These moles were then divided by the acid volume (25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3) to give the concentration of H2SO4. All intermediate results were retained to three‑significant‑figure precision as required by the source values.",
