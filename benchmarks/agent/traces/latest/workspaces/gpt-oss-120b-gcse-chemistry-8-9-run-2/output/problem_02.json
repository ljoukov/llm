  "method": "The mass of CaCO3 in the limestone was obtained by multiplying the sample mass (5.00 g) by the purity (84.0%). This mass (4.20 g) was converted to moles using the molar mass of CaCO3 (100.1 g·mol‑1). The stoichiometry of the reaction shows a 1:1 ratio between CaCO3 and CO2, so the moles of CO2 equal the moles of CaCO3. These moles were then multiplied by the molar mass of CO2 (44.0 g·mol‑1) to give the maximum mass of CO2 that can be produced. All intermediate values were retained to three‑significant‑figure precision as dictated by the input data.",
