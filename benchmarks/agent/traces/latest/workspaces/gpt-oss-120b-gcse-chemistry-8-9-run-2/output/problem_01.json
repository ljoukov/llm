  "method": "Using the dilution relationship c1V1 = c2V2, the initial moles of HCl were calculated from the given concentration (0.200 mol dm-3) and volume (25.0 cm3). These moles were then divided by the final volume (250.0 cm3) to obtain the new concentration. All calculations retain three‑significant‑figure precision as dictated by the source values.",
