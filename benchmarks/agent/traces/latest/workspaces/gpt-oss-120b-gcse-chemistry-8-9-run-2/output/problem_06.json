  "method": "The equilibrium concentrations were calculated by dividing the given moles of each species by the vessel volume (2.00 dm3) as per the concentration definition c = n/V. [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. These concentrations were substituted into the equilibrium expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] to obtain Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0736, a dimensionless quantity. All calculations retain three‑significant‑figure precision as dictated by the source data.",
