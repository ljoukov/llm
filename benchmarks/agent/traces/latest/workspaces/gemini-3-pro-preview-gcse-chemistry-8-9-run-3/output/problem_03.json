  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH used: n = c * V = 0.150 * 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Thus, moles of H2SO4 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4: c = n / V = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
