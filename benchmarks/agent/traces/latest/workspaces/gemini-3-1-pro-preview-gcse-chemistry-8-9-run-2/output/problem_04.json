  "method": "Calculate the total energy required to break the bonds in the reactants: 4 C-H bonds in CH4 (4 * 413 = 1652 kJ) and 2 O=O bonds in O2 (2 * 498 = 996 kJ), giving a total of 2648 kJ. Then calculate the energy released upon forming the bonds in the products: 2 C=O bonds in CO2 (2 * 805 = 1610 kJ) and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O (4 * 463 = 1852 kJ), giving a total of 3462 kJ. Using the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed), subtract the energy formed from the energy broken: 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
