  "method": "First, calculate the total electrical charge passed using Q = I * t. Convert the time to seconds: 30.0 min * 60 = 1800 s. Then, Q = 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C. Next, calculate the moles of electrons transferred by dividing the charge by the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol-1), yielding 0.02798 mol of electrons. The half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu shows that 2 moles of electrons deposit 1 mole of copper, so moles of Cu = 0.02798 / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Finally, multiply by the atomic mass of Cu (63.55) to find the mass: 0.01399 mol * 63.55 g/mol = 0.889 g.",
