  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, we can determine the new concentration. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging the formula for c2 gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The calculation respects the significant figures of the input values.",
