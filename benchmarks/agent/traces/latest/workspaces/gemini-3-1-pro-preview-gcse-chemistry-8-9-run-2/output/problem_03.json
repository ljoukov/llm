  "method": "To find the concentration of H2SO4, first calculate the moles of NaOH used in the titration. Using n = c * V, the moles of NaOH is 0.150 mol dm-3 * 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced reaction equation, the molar ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Therefore, the moles of H2SO4 is 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, determine the concentration of H2SO4 by dividing its moles by its volume in dm3: c = n / V = 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
