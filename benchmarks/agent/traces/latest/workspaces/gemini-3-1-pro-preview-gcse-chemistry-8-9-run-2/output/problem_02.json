  "method": "First, calculate the actual mass of pure CaCO3 in the limestone sample by taking 84.0% of the 5.00 g total mass, which gives 4.20 g of CaCO3. Using the molar mass of CaCO3 (100.1 g/mol), calculate the moles of CaCO3: n = 4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.041958 mol. According to the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so 0.041958 moles of CO2 are produced. Finally, multiply the moles of CO2 by its molar mass (44.0 g/mol) to find the maximum mass of CO2: 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 1.846 g, rounded to 1.85 g (3 significant figures).",
