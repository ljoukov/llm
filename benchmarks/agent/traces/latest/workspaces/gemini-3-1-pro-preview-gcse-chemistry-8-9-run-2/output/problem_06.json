    "precision_note": "The inputs for moles and volume are provided to 3 significant figures, so the calculated Kc is rounded to 3 significant figures."
  },
  "method": "To find the equilibrium constant Kc, first calculate the equilibrium concentration of each gas by dividing the number of moles by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3). The concentration of NO2 is 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. The concentration of N2O4 is 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Using the equilibrium expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4], substitute the calculated concentrations: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The result is reported without units as per the report instructions.",
