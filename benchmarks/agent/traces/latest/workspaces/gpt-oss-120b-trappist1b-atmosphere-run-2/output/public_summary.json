  "headline": "JWST phase‑curve data suggest TRAPPIST‑1 b may host a thin atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "Observations of the exoplanet TRAPPIST‑1 b with the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid‑Infrared Instrument recorded how the planet’s brightness changes as it orbits its star. The temperature measured on the day side (about 342 K) and a modest amount of heat being moved to the night side indicate the planet is not completely airless. A weak absorption feature around 15 µm, consistent with carbon‑dioxide, further supports the presence of an atmosphere, though the exact composition and pressure remain uncertain. The study highlights that while the data favor an atmospheric scenario, additional observations are needed to confirm the details and rule out alternative explanations such as clouds or surface effects.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The joint analysis of thermal phase variations and a 96 ppm CO₂‑band dip yields a likelihood ratio of 7.4, strongly favoring atmospheric models over a bare‑rock scenario.",
    "A non‑zero heat‑transport efficiency (ε ≈ 0.19) is measured, implying measurable day‑night energy redistribution.",
    "The planet’s Bond albedo is constrained to be very low (< 0.08), indicating a dark surface or atmosphere that absorbs most incoming stellar light."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The inferred atmospheric properties depend on retrieval assumptions about circulation, cloud treatment, and opacity priors.",
    "Spectral features are weak and could be affected by instrumental systematics or stellar variability.",
    "The study examines only a single planet, so the results cannot be generalized to other rocky worlds around M dwarfs."
