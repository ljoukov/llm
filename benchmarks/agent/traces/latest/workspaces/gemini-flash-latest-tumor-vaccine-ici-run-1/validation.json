This study investigated a new approach: using an mRNA vaccine, similar to those used for COVID-19, delivered directly into the tumor to make it more visible to the immune system and the ICIs. In mouse models, this intratumoral mRNA approach led to a significant increase in antigen presentation (e.g., MHC-I peptidome fraction rose from 20.6% to 40.6%) and inflammation (Type I interferon score rose from 1.0 to 3.1). These changes primed the tumor for the anti-PD-L1 therapy, showing improved tumor control. This finding was supported by a retrospective study in 130 metastatic cancer patients, where the 43 patients who had previously received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine showed an improved survival outcome under ICI treatment (p=0.01).
