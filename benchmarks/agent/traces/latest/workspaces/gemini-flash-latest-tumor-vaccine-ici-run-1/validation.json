Researchers found that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors in mice triggers a strong immune alarm signal (Type I interferon). This signal helps the tumor cells display more of their unique markers (antigens) on their surface, essentially making the tumor more 'visible' to the patient's own T-cells. This sensitization effect, which includes a 2.4-fold increase in the targetable protein PD-L1, makes the subsequent ICI therapy much more effective, as demonstrated by improved tumor control in mice. Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of 130 human metastatic patients receiving ICI treatment found that those who had received a prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine had a statistically significant improvement in survival (p=0.01).
