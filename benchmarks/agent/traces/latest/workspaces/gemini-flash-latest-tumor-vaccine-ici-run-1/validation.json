This study, which combined preclinical mouse experiments with a retrospective analysis of human patients, found a promising way to make tumors more visible and responsive to ICIs. In mouse models, delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors triggered a powerful innate immune signal (Type I interferon). This signal caused the tumors to display a broader range of their hidden proteins on their surface (immunopeptidome), effectively increasing the 'visibility' of the cancer to T cells. The combined treatment (mRNA vaccine + ICI) showed strong anti-tumor effects in mice. Crucially, a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic cancer patients who received ICI treatment showed that those who had received a prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination had a statistically significant improvement in survival (p=0.01) compared to those who had not.
