  "major_limitations": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, meaning residual confounding from other factors is likely.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients, making it difficult to precisely align the proposed mechanism with outcome.",
    "Tumor-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity limit direct causal interpretation of the improved survival data in humans.",
    "Mouse model effects, while informative, may not map one-to-one to the complex biology of all human tumors."
