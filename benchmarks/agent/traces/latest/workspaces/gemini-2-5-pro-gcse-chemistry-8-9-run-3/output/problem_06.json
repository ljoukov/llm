    "method": "First, the concentrations of the gases at equilibrium are calculated by dividing the number of moles by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3). [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Then, these concentrations are substituted into the equilibrium constant expression, Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0081 / 0.110 = 0.073636... Rounding to three significant figures gives Kc = 0.0736.",
