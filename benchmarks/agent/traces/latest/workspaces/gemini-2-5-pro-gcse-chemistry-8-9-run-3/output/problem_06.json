    },
    "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the reactant (N2O4) and the product (NO2) by dividing their given mole amounts by the volume of the vessel in dm3. Then, substitute these concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction, Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. The concentration of NO2 is squared due to its stoichiometric coefficient of 2 in the balanced equation. The final value of Kc is reported as a unitless quantity as specified.",
