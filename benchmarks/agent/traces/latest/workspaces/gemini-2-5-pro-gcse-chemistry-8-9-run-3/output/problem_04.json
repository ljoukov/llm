    "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) of the reaction is estimated by calculating the difference between the total energy of bonds broken and the total energy of bonds formed. First, identify all the bonds broken in the reactants (CH4 and 2O2): four C-H bonds and two O=O bonds. Calculate the total energy absorbed to break these bonds using the provided bond energies. Next, identify all the bonds formed in the products (CO2 and 2H2O): two C=O bonds and four O-H bonds. Calculate the total energy released when these bonds are formed. Finally, subtract the total energy of bonds formed from the total energy of bonds broken to find deltaH.",
