    "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) is calculated using the formula: deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). First, calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants. In one mole of CH4, there are 4 C-H bonds, so 4 * 413 kJ is required. In two moles of O2, there are 2 O=O bonds, so 2 * 498 kJ is required. Total energy for bond breaking = (4 * 413) + (2 * 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ. Next, calculate the energy released when forming bonds in the products. In one mole of CO2, there are 2 C=O bonds, so 2 * 805 kJ is released. In two moles of H2O, there are 4 O-H bonds (2 per molecule), so 4 * 463 kJ is released. Total energy from bond formation = (2 * 805) + (4 * 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ. Finally, deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
