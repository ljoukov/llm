    "method": "First, calculate the number of moles of NaOH used in the titration by multiplying its concentration by the volume used (converted to dm3). Then, use the stoichiometry of the balanced reaction equation (H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O) to determine the number of moles of H2SO4 that reacted; the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Finally, calculate the concentration of the H2SO4 solution by dividing the moles of H2SO4 by its volume (converted to dm3).",
