    "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g * (84.0 / 100) = 4.20 g. Then, calculate the moles of CaCO3 using the formula n = m / Mr: 4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.041958 mol. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the mole ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so the moles of CO2 produced are also 0.041958 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 by multiplying the moles by its molar mass (Mr = 44.0): 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 1.846 g. This is rounded to 1.85 g for three significant figures.",
