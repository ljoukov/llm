    "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the limestone sample by multiplying the total mass by the percentage of purity. Then, use the formula n = m / Mr to find the number of moles of CaCO3, using the molar mass of CaCO3. According to the stoichiometry of the balanced reaction equation, the mole ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so the moles of CO2 produced are equal to the moles of CaCO3 reacted. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 produced by multiplying the moles of CO2 by its molar mass.",
