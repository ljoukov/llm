    "method": "First, convert the initial and final volumes from cm3 to dm3 by dividing by 1000. Then, apply the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 and V1 are the initial concentration and volume, and c2 and V2 are the final concentration and volume. Rearrange the formula to solve for the final concentration, c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substitute the given values to calculate the final concentration of HCl.",
