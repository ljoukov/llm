    "method": "The dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2 is used. The initial volume V1 is 25.0 cm3, which is 0.0250 dm3. The initial concentration c1 is 0.200 mol dm-3. The final volume V2 is 250.0 cm3 or 0.250 dm3. The equation is rearranged to solve for the final concentration c2: c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 0.0250) / 0.250 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
