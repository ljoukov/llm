    "method": "First, calculate the total charge passed using the equation Q = I * t. The time must be in seconds, so 30.0 min * 60 s/min = 1800 s. Q = 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C. Next, calculate the moles of electrons using the Faraday constant: n(e-) = Q / F = 2700 C / 96,500 C mol-1 = 0.027979 mol. According to the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, two moles of electrons are required to deposit one mole of copper. Therefore, the moles of copper deposited are n(Cu) = n(e-) / 2 = 0.027979 / 2 = 0.0139895 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of copper deposited by multiplying the moles of copper by its atomic mass (63.55): 0.0139895 mol * 63.55 g/mol = 0.88903 g, which is rounded to 0.889 g.",
