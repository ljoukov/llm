    "method": "First, convert the time from minutes to seconds. Then, calculate the total electric charge (Q) passed using the formula Q = I * t. Next, use the Faraday constant (F) to find the moles of electrons (n(e-)) by the formula n(e-) = Q / F. From the cathode half-equation (Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu), determine the moles of copper deposited, noting the 2:1 mole ratio of electrons to copper. Finally, calculate the mass of copper deposited by multiplying the moles of copper by its atomic mass (Ar).",
