The results show that the planet is likely not a completely \\\"bare rock\\\" with no atmosphere. Key findings include a measured amount of heat transport from the hot day side to the cooler night side, which is hard to explain without some form of atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the light spectrum shows a slight dip around 15 micrometers, a feature consistent with absorption by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2).
