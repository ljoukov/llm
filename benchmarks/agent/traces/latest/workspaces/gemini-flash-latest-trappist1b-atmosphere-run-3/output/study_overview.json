    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets. (L47)",
    "Retrieval assumptions (circulation, opacity priors, cloud treatment) affect the quantitative posteriors derived for atmospheric properties. (L48)",
    "Degeneracies between composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation assumptions remain significant, limiting definitive constraint on one single atmospheric model. (L37)",
    "Night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints in the current JWST MIRI dataset. (L50)"
