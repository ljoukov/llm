  "headline": "JWST observations suggest TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere, defying expectations for a bare rock.",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized rocky planet orbiting very close to its star, likely with one side always facing the star (tidally locked). Scientists expected such a planet to be a bare rock with no atmosphere because of intense stellar irradiation. Using JWST's MIRI instrument, astronomers observed the planet's thermal glow as it orbited its star, measuring how heat is distributed between the day and night sides. They found evidence that heat is being redistributed between the hemispheres, and detected a spectral feature consistent with CO2 absorption. Both findings suggest the presence of an atmosphere rather than a bare surface. However, the composition and pressure of any atmosphere remain highly uncertain, and alternative interpretations cannot yet be ruled out. Follow-up observations with broader wavelength coverage are essential to confirm and characterize any atmosphere.",
