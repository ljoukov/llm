    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets.",

    "Night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints in the current dataset.",
    "Degeneracies between composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation assumptions remain significant."
