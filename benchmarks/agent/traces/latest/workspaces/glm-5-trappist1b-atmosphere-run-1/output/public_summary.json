  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized planet orbiting very close to its star, raising questions about whether it could hold onto an atmosphere under intense radiation. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists observed how the planet's brightness changes as it orbits, revealing day-night temperature differences and subtle spectral features near 15 micrometers. The data show that a completely airless rock cannot easily explain both the temperature patterns and the spectral signature together. Instead, models with a moderate-pressure atmosphere containing gases like carbon dioxide fit the observations better. However, the exact composition and pressure remain uncertain, and the evidence is not yet conclusive. Follow-up observations will be needed to confirm whether TRAPPIST-1 b truly has an atmosphere and to determine what gases it might contain.",

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This study examines only one planet and cannot establish how common atmospheres are around M-dwarf rocky worlds.",
    "Model assumptions about clouds, circulation, and gas opacity affect the quantitative results.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument noise could mimic or hide weak atmospheric signals.",
    "Night-side temperature constraints are weaker than day-side constraints."
