  "headline": "JWST finds hints of an atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 b, a nearby rocky exoplanet.",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized rocky planet orbiting very close to a small, cool star. Scientists wanted to know if it could hold onto an atmosphere despite the harsh conditions. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, they measured heat patterns across the planet's surface as it orbited. They found that the planet's heat distribution suggests something is moving heat from the hot day side to the cooler night side, which a bare rock would not do. They also spotted a subtle chemical signature that could come from carbon dioxide in an atmosphere. While these clues point toward an atmosphere, the exact composition and pressure are still uncertain, and more observations are needed to confirm and characterize it.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "First detection of heat redistribution on TRAPPIST-1 b that suggests atmospheric heat transport rather than a bare rock surface.",
    "Detection of a 96 ppm spectral feature near 15 micrometers consistent with CO2 atmospheric absorption.",
    "Joint analysis of phase curve and spectrum shows atmosphere-bearing models explain the data 7.4 times better than no-atmosphere models."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This study examines only one planet, so we cannot generalize about other rocky planets around M dwarf stars.",
    "The retrieval results depend on assumptions about atmospheric circulation, opacity, and clouds that affect the numerical outcomes.",
    "Weak spectral features could be influenced by stellar variability or instrument systematics rather than genuine atmospheric signals.",
    "Night-side properties are less constrained than day-side properties in the current dataset."
