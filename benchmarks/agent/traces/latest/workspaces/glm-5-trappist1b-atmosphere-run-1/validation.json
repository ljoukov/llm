Because of this close orbit, scientists expected it might have lost any atmosphere it once had due to intense stellar radiation. However, new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope reveal surprising evidence that challenges this expectation. By measuring how the planet's heat changes as it orbits and by looking for chemical fingerprints in the light it emits, researchers found that TRAPPIST-1 b may have some atmosphere after all. The planet's dayside temperature is about 342 Kelvin, and its heat distribution pattern suggests winds or circulation that would not exist on a bare rock. A faint spectral signature near 15 microns hints at carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
