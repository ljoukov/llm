In several mouse tumor models, the combination arm showed stronger evidence of immune activation than controls: broader antigen representation, stronger MHC-I peptide presentation, higher type I interferon response, increased PD-L1 expression, and higher intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density. Control analyses reported limited benefit in vaccine-only or ICI-only settings and loss of effect when type I interferon signaling was blocked, supporting a mechanistic pathway. In a retrospective cohort of 130 metastatic patients treated with ICIs, 43 had prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and 87 had not, with a reported survival p-value of 0.01 favoring the vaccinated subgroup.

        "Key quantitative immune-readout metrics are attributed to the \"combination arm\" in the public summary, but the report’s quantitative table frames several of them specifically as effects \"after intratumoral mRNA vaccination\" (for example, immunopeptidome breadth and MHC-I peptidome expansion at L28–L29; type I IFN score at L31; PD-L1 fold-change at L32). Only the CD8+ density explicitly references \"combination therapy\" in the report (L33). This arm-misattribution is a substantive design/evidence-strength error that can mislead downstream reviewers about what component drives which readout.",
        "In claim_audit.json, Claim C02 (“mRNA vaccination induces higher type I interferon activity…”) cites L28 (immunopeptidome fraction) as evidence alongside L31. L28 does not provide evidence of interferon induction; it is an antigen-presentation breadth metric. This is not a numeric fabrication, but it is an invalid/irrelevant grounding choice that weakens traceability for that claim.",
        "Some interpretations are phrased more strongly/causally than the report supports for human data (for example, public_summary implies a translational \"strategy\" based on retrospective association). While caveats are included, the arm-misattribution plus the human association could lead reviewers to over-credit efficacy or mechanism as established in patients (contrast L49–L52)."

However, the public-facing narrative repeatedly misassigns several quantitative mechanistic readouts to the combination arm, whereas the report text ties multiple readouts to intratumoral mRNA vaccination generally and only explicitly ties CD8+ density to combination therapy. This misrepresentation of which intervention produced which effect is a core"
