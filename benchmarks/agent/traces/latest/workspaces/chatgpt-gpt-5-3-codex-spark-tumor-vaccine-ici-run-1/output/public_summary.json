  "headline": "Intratumoral mRNA vaccination may sensitize tumors to checkpoint blockade",
  "plain_language_summary": "This study tested whether injecting mRNA vaccines directly into tumors can make cancers more visible to the immune system and improve responses to anti-PD-L1 therapy. In several mouse tumor models, the combination arm showed stronger evidence of immune activation than controls: broader antigen representation, stronger MHC-I peptide presentation, higher type I interferon response, increased PD-L1 expression, and higher intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density. Control analyses reported limited benefit in vaccine-only or ICI-only settings and loss of effect when type I interferon signaling was blocked, supporting a mechanistic pathway. In a retrospective cohort of 130 metastatic patients treated with ICIs, 43 had prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and 87 had not, with a reported survival p-value of 0.01 favoring the vaccinated subgroup. The authors therefore propose a translational sensitization strategy but stress that retrospective, non-randomized evidence is not sufficient to change clinical protocols without prospective randomized confirmation.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The work links preclinical mechanistic studies to a human retrospective association in one translational framework.",
    "It reports a required role for type I interferon signaling, including loss of sensitization when anti-IFNAR1 is applied.",
    "The study documents coordinated quantitative changes in antigen presentation, interferon signaling, PD-L1, and T-cell infiltration with intratumoral mRNA vaccination."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, so confounding can affect apparent survival differences.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients and may influence apparent benefit.",
    "The retrospective cohort was heterogeneous in tumor types and treatment histories, limiting direct causal interpretation.",
    "Mouse-model findings may not translate equally across all human cancers.",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest only in specific models rather than uniformly across all tests."
