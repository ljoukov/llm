Scientists used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe the planet as it orbited its star, measuring both its heat and light spectrum. The key question was whether the planet has an atmosphere or if it is a bare rock. The study found that the planet's day side is not as hot as expected for a bare rock, suggesting that heat is being moved to the night side, possibly by an atmosphere. Additionally, the spectrum showed signs of carbon dioxide (CO2). Models including an atmosphere fit the data better than models without one. However, the exact composition is still uncertain, and more observations are needed to confirm these findings.

This is a substantive interpretive overreach.",

Calling it explicit \"signs of CO2\" is stronger than the report’s calibrated language and downplays the stated ambiguity.",

For example, C01/C02/C04 are marked \"strong\" even though the report emphasizes degeneracies (L37), systematics (L49), and weaker nightside constraints (L50). While the mechanistic chain is presented (L39-L44), the overall evidential strength about atmosphere presence is framed as meaningful but not definitive (L53)."
