  "method": "Find equilibrium concentrations in the 2.00 dm3 vessel by dividing moles by volume: [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Substitute into Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]: Kc = (0.0900^2) / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. Kc is reported as a unitless (dimensionless) value.",

    "If all concentrations were scaled by the same factor, Kc should not depend on vessel size; using concentrations gives a consistent unitless result.",
    "Sanity: [NO2] < [N2O4], so Kc should be less than 1; 0.0736 fits."
