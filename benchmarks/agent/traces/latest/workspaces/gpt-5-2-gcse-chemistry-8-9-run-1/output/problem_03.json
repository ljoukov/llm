From H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O, 2 mol NaOH react with 1 mol H2SO4, so n(H2SO4) = 0.00351/2 = 0.001755 mol. The acid volume is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3, so c(H2SO4) = n/V = 0.001755/0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Acid concentration is lower than NaOH concentration because fewer moles of acid are present for a similar volume (due to 1:2 stoichiometry), so 0.0702 mol dm-3 is reasonable.",
