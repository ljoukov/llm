  "method": "Convert the NaOH titre to dm3: 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3. Use c = n/V rearranged to n = cV: n(NaOH)=0.150×0.02340=0.00351 mol. From H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, 2 mol NaOH neutralize 1 mol H2SO4, so n(H2SO4)=0.00351/2=0.001755 mol. The acid volume is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3, therefore c(H2SO4)=n/V=0.001755/0.02500=0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "If acid were 0.070 mol dm-3, moles in 0.0250 dm3 is ~0.00175 mol, matching stoichiometry from NaOH.",
    "Concentration is lower than NaOH concentration, as expected because NaOH volume is similar but 2:1 base:acid ratio."
