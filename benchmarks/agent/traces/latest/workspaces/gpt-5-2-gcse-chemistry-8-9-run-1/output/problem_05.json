  "method": "Convert time to seconds: 30.0 min = 30.0×60 = 1800 s. Charge passed: Q = I×t = 1.50×1800 = 2700 C. Moles of electrons transferred: n(e−) = Q/F = 2700/96500 = 0.02798 mol. From Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu, 2 mol e− deposit 1 mol Cu, so n(Cu) = 0.02798/2 = 0.01399 mol. Using Ar(Cu) = 63.55, mass deposited m = n×Ar = 0.01399×63.55 = 0.889 g.",

    "If time or current were doubled, the mass would double (mass ∝ charge), consistent with Faraday’s laws.",
    "Computed moles of Cu (~0.014 mol) corresponds to under 1 g (since 0.014×63.55 ≈ 0.89), which matches the final result."
