  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure calcium carbonate in the limestone sample by multiplying the total mass (5.00 g) by the purity (84.0% or 0.840), which gives 4.20 g of CaCO3. Next, determine the number of moles of CaCO3 by dividing its mass by its molar mass (Mr = 100.1 g/mol), resulting in approximately 0.04196 moles. From the balanced chemical equation, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so 0.04196 moles of CO2 are produced. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 by multiplying the moles by the molar mass of CO2 (44.0 g/mol), which yields 1.84615... g, rounded to 1.85 g.",
