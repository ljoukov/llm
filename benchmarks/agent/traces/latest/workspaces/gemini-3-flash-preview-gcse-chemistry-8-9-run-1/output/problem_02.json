  "method": "First, the mass of pure calcium carbonate in the limestone sample is calculated by multiplying the total sample mass (5.00 g) by the purity (84.0% or 0.84), resulting in 4.20 g of CaCO3. Next, the number of moles of CaCO3 is determined using its molar mass (100.1 g/mol) from the formula n = m / Mr, which gives 4.20 / 100.1 = 0.041958 mol. According to the balanced chemical equation, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1. Therefore, 0.041958 mol of CO2 is produced. Finally, the mass of CO2 is calculated using its molar mass (44.0 g/mol) as m = n * Mr, resulting in 0.041958 * 44.0 = 1.84615 g, which rounds to 1.85 g.",
