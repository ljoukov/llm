  "method": "First, the mass of pure CaCO3 in the limestone is calculated by multiplying the total sample mass (5.00 g) by the purity percentage (84.0%), resulting in 4.20 g of CaCO3. Next, the amount of CaCO3 in moles is determined using the formula n = m / Mr, with Mr(CaCO3) given as 100.1, giving approximately 0.041958 moles. According to the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so 0.041958 moles of CO2 are produced. Finally, the mass of CO2 is calculated by multiplying these moles by the Mr of CO2 (44.0), yielding approximately 1.846 g, which is rounded to 1.85 g for the final result.",
