  "method": "The calculation of copper mass begins with finding the total charge passed (Q) using Q = I * t. The current is 1.50 A and the time is 30.0 minutes (1800 seconds), so Q = 1.50 * 1800 = 2700 C. The moles of electrons are then found using n(e-) = Q / F, where F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol-1), giving 2700 / 96500 = 0.027979 mol. According to the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, the molar ratio of electrons to copper is 2:1, so the moles of Cu deposited is 0.027979 / 2 = 0.013990 mol. Finally, the mass is calculated as moles * Ar(Cu) = 0.013990 * 63.55 = 0.889 g.",
