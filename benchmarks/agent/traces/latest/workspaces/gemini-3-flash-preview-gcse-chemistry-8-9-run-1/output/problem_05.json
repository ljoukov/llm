  "method": "First, convert the time from minutes to seconds: 30.0 min * 60 s/min = 1800 s. Then, calculate the total charge (Q) passed through the circuit using Q = I * t, which is 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C. Next, find the number of moles of electrons (n(e-)) using n(e-) = Q / F, where F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol-1), resulting in approximately 0.02798 moles of electrons. From the cathode half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, 2 moles of electrons deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore, moles of Cu = 0.02798 / 2 = 0.01399 moles. Finally, calculate the mass of copper by multiplying the moles by the atomic mass of copper (63.55 g/mol), which gives 0.889 g.",
