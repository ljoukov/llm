  "method": "First, calculate the total electric charge (Q) passed through the circuit using Q = I * t. With a current of 1.50 A and a time of 30.0 minutes (1800 seconds), Q = 1.50 * 1800 = 2700 C. Next, find the number of moles of electrons using n(e-) = Q / F, where F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol-1). This gives 2700 / 96,500 = 0.027979 mol. From the cathode half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, the ratio of electrons to copper is 2:1, so the moles of Cu deposited is 0.027979 / 2 = 0.0139896 mol. Finally, the mass of copper is m = n * Ar(Cu) = 0.0139896 * 63.55 = 0.889 g.",
