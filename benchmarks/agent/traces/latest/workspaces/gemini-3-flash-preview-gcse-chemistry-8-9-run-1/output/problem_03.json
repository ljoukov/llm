  "method": "To find the concentration of H2SO4, we first calculate the moles of NaOH used in the titration. Using the formula n = c * V, where concentration is 0.150 mol dm-3 and volume is 23.40 cm3 (or 0.02340 dm3), we get 0.00351 mol of NaOH. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Thus, the moles of H2SO4 are 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 is calculated by dividing the moles by its volume (25.00 cm3 or 0.02500 dm3), resulting in 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
