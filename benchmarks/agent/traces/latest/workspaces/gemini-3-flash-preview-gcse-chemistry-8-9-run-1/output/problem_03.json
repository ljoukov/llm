  "method": "The titration calculation begins by determining the moles of NaOH used. Using the formula c = n / V from the report, moles of NaOH = 0.150 mol dm-3 * (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. Based on the balanced chemical equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the molar ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Therefore, the moles of H2SO4 required for neutralization is 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 is calculated by dividing the moles by the volume in dm3: 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
