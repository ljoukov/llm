  "method": "First, calculate the number of moles of NaOH used in the titration by multiplying its concentration (0.150 mol dm-3) by its volume in dm3 (23.40 cm3 / 1000 = 0.02340 dm3), giving 0.00351 moles. According to the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the molar ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Thus, the moles of H2SO4 neutralized are half the moles of NaOH, which is 0.001755 moles. Finally, find the concentration of H2SO4 by dividing the moles (0.001755) by its volume in dm3 (25.00 cm3 / 1000 = 0.02500 dm3), resulting in 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
