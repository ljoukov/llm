  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of NO2 and N2O4 by dividing their respective number of moles by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3). [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Next, use the equilibrium constant expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] to calculate Kc. Substituting the concentrations: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0081 / 0.110. This calculation results in approximately 0.073636, which is rounded to 0.0736. As per instructions, Kc is reported as dimensionless.",
