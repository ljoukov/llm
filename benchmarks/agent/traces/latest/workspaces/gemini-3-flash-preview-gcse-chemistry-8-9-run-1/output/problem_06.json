  "method": "To calculate Kc for the equilibrium N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g), the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products must first be determined. The concentrations are calculated by dividing the number of moles by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3), yielding [NO2] = 0.180 / 2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 / 2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. These values are then substituted into the equilibrium constant expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. The calculation (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 results in 0.0081 / 0.110, which equals approximately 0.0736.",
