  "method": "To calculate the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g), we first determine the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved. The concentration is calculated by dividing the number of moles by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3). Thus, [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3, and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Using the Kc expression given in the report, Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4], we substitute the values: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0081 / 0.110 = 0.073636. Per the instructions, Kc is reported as dimensionless, rounded to 0.0736.",
