  "method": "The calculation follows the principle of conservation of moles during dilution, expressed by the formula c1V1 = c2V2 provided in the report. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The total final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. By rearranging the formula to solve for the final concentration (c2 = c1V1 / V2), the values are substituted: (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3. This calculation results in a new concentration of 0.0200 mol dm-3 HCl.",
