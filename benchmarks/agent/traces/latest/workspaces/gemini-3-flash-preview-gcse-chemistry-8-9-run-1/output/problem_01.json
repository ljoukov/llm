  "method": "The task is to calculate the new concentration of HCl after dilution. Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 is the initial concentration, V1 is the initial volume, c2 is the final concentration, and V2 is the final volume. From the report, V1 = 25.0 cm3, c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3, and V2 = 250.0 cm3. Rearranging for c2 gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "Check the dilution factor: the volume increased by a factor of 10 (25 to 250), so the concentration should decrease by a factor of 10 (0.200 to 0.0200).",
    "Units are consistent: volumes are in cm3 on both sides of the equation, and concentration is in mol dm-3."
