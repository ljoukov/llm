  "method": "The concentration of the diluted solution is calculated using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging the formula to solve for the final concentration (c2) gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the known values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3. The units of volume cancel out, resulting in a final concentration of 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
