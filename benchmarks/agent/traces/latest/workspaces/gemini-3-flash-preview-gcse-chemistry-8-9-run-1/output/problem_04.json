  "method": "To estimate the enthalpy change (deltaH) for methane combustion, we use mean bond energies. First, calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants: 4 C-H bonds in CH4 (4 * 413) and 2 O=O bonds in 2O2 (2 * 498), totaling 2648 kJ mol-1. Next, calculate the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products: 2 C=O bonds in CO2 (2 * 805) and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O (4 * 463), totaling 3462 kJ mol-1. Finally, applying the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed), we get 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",

    "Verify the calculation: (1652 + 996) - (1610 + 1852) = -814.",
    "The negative sign indicates an exothermic reaction, which is expected for combustion."
