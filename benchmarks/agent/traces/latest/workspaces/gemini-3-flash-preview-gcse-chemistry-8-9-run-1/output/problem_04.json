  "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) is calculated using the bond energy formula: deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). Bonds broken in the reactants include four C-H bonds from CH4 (4 * 413 = 1652 kJ mol-1) and two O=O bonds from 2O2 (2 * 498 = 996 kJ mol-1), totaling 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed in the products include two C=O bonds from CO2 (2 * 805 = 1610 kJ mol-1) and four O-H bonds from 2H2O (4 * 463 = 1852 kJ mol-1), totaling 3462 kJ mol-1. Subtracting the total energy of bonds formed from the total energy of bonds broken gives 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
