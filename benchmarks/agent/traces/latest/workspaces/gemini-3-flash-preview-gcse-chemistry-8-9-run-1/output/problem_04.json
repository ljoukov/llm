  "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) for methane combustion is estimated by calculating the energy required to break bonds in the reactants and the energy released when bonds are formed in the products. Bonds broken: 4 C-H bonds (4 * 413) and 2 O=O bonds (2 * 498), totaling 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed: 2 C=O bonds (2 * 805) and 4 O-H bonds (4 * 463), totaling 3462 kJ mol-1. Using the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed), we get 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative value indicates an exothermic reaction.",
