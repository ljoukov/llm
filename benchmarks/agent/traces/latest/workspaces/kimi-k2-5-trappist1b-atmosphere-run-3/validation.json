        "Invalid/unsupported verbatim quoting in claim_audit.json: multiple evidence “quotes” are not present verbatim in the provided report lines, and the grader metadata already flags these (C01/L31, C02/L28, C03/L30). This breaks the requirement that line references/quotes map correctly to the numbered report lines.",
        "Overstatement of evidence strength in claim_audit.json C04: it labels the claim strength as “strong” while the cited report statement is explicitly cautious (“O2-rich atmosphere cases are not fully ruled out by current data.” L36). That supports at most a weak/tentative claim, not a strong one.",
        "Overstated language implying confirmed detection/establishment of an atmosphere: claim_audit.json C01 says “TRAPPIST-1 b has an atmosphere…”. The report is more calibrated: “meaningful evidence against a strictly airless interpretation” with uncertainty and need for follow-up (L53). The public_summary headline similarly leans definitive; it should remain explicitly probabilistic.",
        "public_summary.json includes novelty phrasing not grounded in the report: “This is the first phase-curve study of TRAPPIST-1 b using JWST MIRI spectroscopy” is not stated anywhere in the provided report lines (no supporting line reference), so it is an ungrounded claim.",
        "public_summary.json “what_is_new” uses ‘detection’ framing for epsilon=0.19 (“The detection of non-zero heat transport efficiency… provides evidence…”). The report’s calibration is that non-zero redistribution is favored (L28) with large uncertainties and weaker nightside constraints (L50); calling it a detection without uncertainty language is too strong."

However, the overall output set fails the grading criteria because claim_audit.json contains evidence quotes that do not exist verbatim in the report lines (making its line-to-quote grounding invalid), and it miscalibrates claim strength (notably calling an ‘not ruled out’ statement “strong”/"
