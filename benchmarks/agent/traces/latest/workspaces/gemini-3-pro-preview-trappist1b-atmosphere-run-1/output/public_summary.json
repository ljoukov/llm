  "headline": "JWST Finds Potential Signs of an Atmosphere on Earth-Sized Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed TRAPPIST-1 b, an Earth-sized rocky planet orbiting a small red star. The study focused on measuring the planet's heat and light across its orbit to see if it has an atmosphere. A bare rock would have a very hot day side and a freezing night side, but the data suggests some heat is being moved around the planet, which usually requires an atmosphere. Additionally, the telescope detected hints of carbon dioxide. While these findings point towards an atmosphere, other possibilities like an oxygen-rich atmosphere or measurement errors haven't been completely ruled out. This is a significant step in understanding whether rocky planets around such stars can hold onto their air.",
