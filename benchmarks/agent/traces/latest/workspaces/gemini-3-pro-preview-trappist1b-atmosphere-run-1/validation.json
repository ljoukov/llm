This is a crucial step in understanding whether planets around the most common stars in the galaxy can support life. The team used the MIRI instrument to observe the heat coming from the planet as it orbited its star, allowing them to measure the temperature of both its day and night sides. They found that the planet redistributes heat more effectively than a bare rock would, and they detected a spectral signature consistent with carbon dioxide. While these findings are promising, they are not definitive proof.
