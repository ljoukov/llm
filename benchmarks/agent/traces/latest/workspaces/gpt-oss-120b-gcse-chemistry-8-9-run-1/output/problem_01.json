  "method": "The dilution equation c₂ = c₁·V₁/V₂ was applied. Initial concentration (c₁) of 0.200 mol dm-3 and initial volume (V₁) of 25.0 cm³ were multiplied, then divided by the final volume (V₂) of 250.0 cm³ to obtain the new concentration. All calculations were carried out using the three‑significant‑figure data provided, and the final answer was expressed to the same precision.",
