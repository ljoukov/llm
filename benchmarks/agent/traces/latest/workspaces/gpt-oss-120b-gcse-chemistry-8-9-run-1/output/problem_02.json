  "method": "The mass of CaCO3 in the limestone is obtained from the given percentage: 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Using the molar mass of CaCO3 (100.1 g mol⁻¹) the amount of CaCO3 is 4.20 g ÷ 100.1 g mol⁻¹ = 0.04196 mol (≈0.0420 mol to 3 sf). The reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO₂ + H₂O shows a 1:1 stoichiometry between CaCO3 and CO₂, so the same number of moles of CO₂ are produced. Multiplying the moles of CO₂ by the molar mass of CO₂ (44.0 g mol⁻¹) gives 0.04196 mol × 44.0 g mol⁻¹ = 1.846 g, which is reported as 1.85 g to the appropriate significant figures.",
