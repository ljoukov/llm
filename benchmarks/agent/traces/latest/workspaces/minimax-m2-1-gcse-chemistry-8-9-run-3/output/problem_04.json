    "value": -814,
    "units": "kJ mol-1",
    "precision_note": "Calculated to 3 significant figures based on input bond energy data precision (all bond energies given as 3-digit integers)"
  },
  "method": "Using the bond energy method: ΔH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). For CH₄ + 2O₂ -> CO₂ + 2H₂O, bonds broken are: 4 × C-H bonds in CH₄, and 2 × O=O bonds in 2O₂. Bonds formed are: 2 × C=O bonds in CO₂, and 4 × O-H bonds in 2H₂O. Calculation: (4 × 413) + (2 × 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1 (energy absorbed). (2 × 805) + (4 × 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1 (energy released). ΔH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative sign indicates an exothermic reaction.",

  "checks": [
    "Combustion reactions are always exothermic, so ΔH should be negative",
    "-814 kJ mol-1 is negative, which is expected",
    "Methane combustion releases significant energy, and this value is in the typical range for hydrocarbon combustion",
    "The magnitude is reasonable compared to known methane combustion enthalpy values"
