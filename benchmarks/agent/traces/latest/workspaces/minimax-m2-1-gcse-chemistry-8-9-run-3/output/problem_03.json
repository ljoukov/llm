  "method": "First, calculate moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = concentration × volume (in dm³) = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm³ = 0.003510 mol. From the balanced equation H₂SO₄ + 2NaOH -> Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O, the stoichiometry shows 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH, so n(H₂SO₄) = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.003510 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate concentration of H₂SO₄: c(H₂SO₄) = n(H₂SO₄) / V(H₂SO₄ in dm³) = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm³ = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

  "checks": [
    "For diprotic acids, the acid volume should be approximately half the base volume for neutralization",
    "Acid:Base volume ratio ≈ 25:23.4 ≈ 1.07, which is close to the expected 1:2 stoichiometric ratio",
    "Concentration of diprotic acid should be roughly half the base concentration",
    "0.0702 ≈ 0.150 / 2.14, which is close to the expected relationship"
