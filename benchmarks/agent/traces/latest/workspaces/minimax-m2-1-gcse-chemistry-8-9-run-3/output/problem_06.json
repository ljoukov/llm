  "method": "First, calculate concentrations from moles: [NO₂] = n(NO₂) / V = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm³ = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N₂O₄] = n(N₂O₄) / V = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm³ = 0.110 mol dm-3. For the equilibrium N₂O₄(g) <-> 2NO₂(g), the equilibrium constant expression is Kc = [NO₂]² / [N₂O₄]. Calculate Kc: Kc = (0.0900)² / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The Kc is reported as dimensionless as specified.",
