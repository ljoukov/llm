  "method": "First, calculate the mass of CaCO₃ in the sample: mass_CaCO₃ = 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Then calculate moles of CaCO₃: n(CaCO₃) = 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 = 0.04196 mol. From the balanced equation CaCO₃ + 2HCl -> CaCl₂ + CO₂ + H₂O, the stoichiometry shows 1:1 ratio between CaCO₃ and CO₂, so n(CO₂) = n(CaCO₃) = 0.04196 mol. Finally, calculate mass of CO₂: m(CO₂) = 0.04196 mol × 44.0 g mol-1 = 1.85 g.",

  "checks": [
    "The mass of CO₂ produced should be less than the mass of CaCO₃ used (4.20 g)",
    "1.85 g < 4.20 g, which is reasonable",
    "The calculated moles of CaCO₃ (0.0420 mol) should produce equal moles of CO₂ (0.0420 mol)",
    "0.0420 mol × 44.0 g/mol ≈ 1.85 g, which matches the result"
