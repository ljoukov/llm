  "method": "First, the total electrical charge (Q) passed is calculated using the formula Q = I * t. The time is converted from minutes to seconds (30.0 min * 60 = 1800 s). Q = 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C. Next, the moles of electrons are found by dividing the charge by the Faraday constant (F): n(e-) = Q / F = 2700 C / 96500 C mol-1 = 0.02798 mol. The cathode half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu shows a 2:1 molar ratio between electrons and copper. Thus, moles of Cu = 0.02798 / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Finally, the mass of copper deposited is calculated by multiplying the moles of Cu by its atomic mass (63.55 g/mol), which gives 0.889 g.",
