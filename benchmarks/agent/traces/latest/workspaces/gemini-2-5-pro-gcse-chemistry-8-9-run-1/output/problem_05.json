    "method": "First, calculate the total charge passed by multiplying the current in Amperes by the time in seconds. Then, calculate the moles of electrons transferred using the Faraday constant. From the stoichiometry of the cathode half-equation, determine the moles of copper deposited. Finally, calculate the mass of copper by multiplying the moles of copper by its relative atomic mass.",
