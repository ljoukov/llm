  "method": "First, convert the time from minutes to seconds: 30.0 min * 60 = 1800 s. Then, calculate the total charge passed using Q = I * t: 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C. Next, find the moles of electrons using n(e-) = Q / F: 2700 C / 96500 C/mol = 0.027979 mol. From the half-equation (Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu), the mole ratio of Cu to electrons is 1:2, so moles of Cu is 0.027979 / 2 = 0.0139895 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of copper deposited using m = n * Mr: 0.0139895 mol * 63.55 g/mol = 0.889 g, rounded to three significant figures.",
