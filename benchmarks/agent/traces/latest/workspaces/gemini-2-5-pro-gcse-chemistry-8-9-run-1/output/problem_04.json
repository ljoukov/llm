  "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) is calculated using the formula: deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). First, calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (CH4 and 2O2): (4 * C-H) + (2 * O=O) = (4 * 413) + (2 * 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ/mol. Next, calculate the energy released when forming bonds in the products (CO2 and 2H2O): (2 * C=O) + (4 * O-H) = (2 * 805) + (4 * 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ/mol. Finally, deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ/mol.",
