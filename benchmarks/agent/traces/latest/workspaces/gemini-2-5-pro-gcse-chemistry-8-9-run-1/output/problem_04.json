  "method": "The enthalpy change of reaction is calculated using the formula: deltaH = sum(energy of bonds broken) - sum(energy of bonds formed). First, identify the bonds broken in the reactants (CH4 and 2O2): four C-H bonds and two O=O bonds. The energy input to break these is (4 * 413) + (2 * 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ/mol. Next, identify the bonds formed in the products (CO2 and 2H2O): two C=O bonds and four O-H bonds. The energy released in forming these is (2 * 805) + (4 * 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ/mol. Finally, deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ/mol.",
