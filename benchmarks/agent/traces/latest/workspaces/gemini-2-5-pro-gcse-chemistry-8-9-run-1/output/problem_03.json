  "method": "First, the moles of NaOH used in the titration are calculated using the formula n = c * V. The volume of NaOH is converted from cm3 to dm3 (23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3). Moles of NaOH = 0.150 mol dm-3 * 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the reaction stoichiometry (H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O), the molar ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Therefore, the moles of H2SO4 are half the moles of NaOH: 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 is calculated by dividing the moles of H2SO4 by its volume in dm3 (25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3), which gives 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
