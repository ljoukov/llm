  },
  "method": "The problem is a straightforward dilution calculation. Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, the final concentration (c2) is found by rearranging to c2 = c1 * (V1 / V2). The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The final diluted volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. Substituting these values gives c2 = 0.200 * (25.0 / 250.0) = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The units of volume cancel out, so no conversion to dm3 is required for the ratio.",
