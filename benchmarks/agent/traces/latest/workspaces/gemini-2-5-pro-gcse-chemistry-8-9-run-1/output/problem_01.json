  "method": "The dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2 is used. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. The volumes are converted to dm3 by dividing by 1000, but the ratio is the same, so we can use cm3 directly. c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "The dilution factor is 250.0 / 25.0 = 10. The new concentration should be the original concentration divided by 10, which is 0.200 / 10 = 0.0200. This matches the calculated answer."
