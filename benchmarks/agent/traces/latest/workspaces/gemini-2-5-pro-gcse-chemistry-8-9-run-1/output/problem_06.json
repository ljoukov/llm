  "method": "The equilibrium constant, Kc, is calculated using the expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. First, the concentrations of NO2 and N2O4 at equilibrium are determined by dividing their molar amounts by the vessel volume (2.00 dm3). This gives [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. These concentration values are then substituted into the Kc expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0081 / 0.110 = 0.0736. As per the instructions, Kc is reported as a dimensionless value.",
