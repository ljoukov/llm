  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of NO2 and N2O4. [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Then, substitute these into the Kc expression: Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0081 / 0.110 = 0.073636... which is rounded to 0.0736.",
