  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g * (84.0 / 100) = 4.20 g. Then, calculate the moles of CaCO3 using n = m / Mr: 4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.041958 mol. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction (CaCO3 -> CO2), the mole ratio is 1:1, so moles of CO2 produced is also 0.041958 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 produced: 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 1.846 g. This is rounded to 1.85 g for three significant figures.",
