  "method": "First, the mass of pure CaCO3 in the limestone sample is calculated by multiplying the total mass (5.00 g) by the purity percentage (84.0%), yielding 4.20 g of CaCO3. Then, the moles of CaCO3 are determined using the formula n = m / Mr, with m = 4.20 g and Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1 g/mol. This gives 0.04196 mol of CaCO3. According to the 1:1 stoichiometric ratio in the reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the moles of CO2 produced are equal to the moles of CaCO3. Finally, the mass of CO2 is calculated by multiplying the moles of CO2 by its molar mass (Mr = 44.0 g/mol), resulting in a final mass of 1.85 g.",
