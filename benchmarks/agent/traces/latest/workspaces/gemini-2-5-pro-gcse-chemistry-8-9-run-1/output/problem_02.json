    "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the 5.00g sample. Then, use the formula n = m / Mr to find the moles of CaCO3. The reaction stoichiometry (1:1) means the moles of CO2 produced are equal to the moles of CaCO3 reacted. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 produced using the formula m = n * Mr.",
