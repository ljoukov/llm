  "method": "Convert equilibrium moles into equilibrium concentrations by dividing by the vessel volume 2.00 dm3. [NO2] = 0.180/2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220/2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Use the given equilibrium expression for N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g): Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Substitute: Kc = (0.0900^2)/0.110 = 0.00810/0.110 = 0.073636..., which rounds to 0.0736 (3 s.f.). Kc is reported as dimensionless.",

    "If [NO2] increased, Kc would increase because it is squared; computed value is small because [NO2] is <0.1.",
    "Using rough numbers: (0.09^2)/0.11 ≈ 0.0081/0.11 ≈ 0.074, matching the final result."
