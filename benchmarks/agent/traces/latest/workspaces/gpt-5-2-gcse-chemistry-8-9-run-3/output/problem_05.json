  "method": "Convert time to seconds: 30.0 min × 60 = 1800 s. Calculate charge passed using Q = I×t: Q = 1.50 A × 1800 s = 2700 C. The Faraday constant is F = 96,500 C mol-1, so moles of electrons transferred is n(e−) = Q/F = 2700/96500 = 0.02798 mol e−. Copper(II) ions require 2 electrons per Cu atom deposited, so n(Cu) = 0.02798/2 = 0.01399 mol. Using the molar mass of Cu (63.55 g mol-1), mass deposited = n×Mr = 0.01399 × 63.55 = 0.8889 g ≈ 0.889 g.",

    "If current or time increased, Q would increase and more Cu would be deposited; the direct proportionality matches Q = It.",
    "Order-of-magnitude: 2700 C is ~0.028 mol e−; halving gives ~0.014 mol Cu; at ~64 g/mol this is just under 1 g, consistent with 0.889 g."
