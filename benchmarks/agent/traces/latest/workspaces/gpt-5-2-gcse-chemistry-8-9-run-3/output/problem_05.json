  "method": "Convert time to seconds: 30.0 min = 30.0×60 = 1800 s. Charge passed is current × time, so Q = 1.50 A × 1800 s = 2700 C. The Faraday constant is 96,500 C mol-1, meaning 96,500 C corresponds to 1 mol of electrons, so moles of electrons transferred are n(e−) = Q/F = 2700/96500 = 0.02798 mol e−. From the cathode half-equation Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu, 2 mol e− produce 1 mol Cu, so n(Cu) = 0.02798/2 = 0.01399 mol. Using Ar(Cu) = 63.55 g mol-1, the mass deposited is m = n×Ar = 0.01399×63.55 = 0.8886 g, which rounds to 0.889 g (3 s.f.).",

    "If charge were much smaller, mass would be much smaller; 2700 C is a moderate charge so <1 g Cu is reasonable.",
    "n(e−) ≈ 2700/96500 ≈ 0.028 mol; dividing by 2 gives ≈ 0.014 mol Cu; 0.014×64 ≈ 0.9 g."
