  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH used, then use the stoichiometric ratio to find moles of H2SO4 and finally divide by the acid volume. Convert 23.40 cm3 to 0.02340 dm3 and use c = n/V: n(NaOH) = c×V = 0.150 × 0.02340 = 0.003510 mol. From H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O, 2 mol NaOH react with 1 mol H2SO4, so n(H2SO4) = 0.003510/2 = 0.001755 mol. The acid volume is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3, so c(H2SO4) = n/V = 0.001755/0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3 (3 s.f.).",

    "Moles NaOH are about 0.15×0.0234 ≈ 0.0035 mol, so moles acid must be half ≈ 0.00175 mol.",
    "Dividing by 0.025 dm3 gives ≈ 0.07 mol dm-3, which is a sensible magnitude."
