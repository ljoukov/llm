  "method": "Use the dilution relationship c1V1 = c2V2. The technician dilutes 25.0 cm3 of 0.200 mol dm-3 HCl to a final volume of 250.0 cm3, so the volume increases by a factor of 250.0/25.0 = 10. Therefore the concentration decreases by the same factor: c2 = c1 × (V1/V2) = 0.200 × (25.0/250.0) = 0.200 × 0.100 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. (The cm3 units cancel in the ratio V1/V2, so no separate cm3→dm3 conversion is required when using the ratio form.)",
