  },
  "method": "Use the dilution relation c1V1 = c2V2. For the initial solution c1 is 0.200 mol dm-3 and V1 is 25.0 cm3. The final volume is V2 = 250.0 cm3. Rearranging gives c2 = c1V1/V2 = 0.200 \u00d7 25.0 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The result is correctly lower than the original concentration because the acid was diluted by a factor of ten.",

    "The final volume is ten times larger than the initial volume, so concentration should be one-tenth the original.",
