  "method": "Convert equilibrium amounts to concentrations by dividing by 2.00 dm3: [NO2] = 0.180/2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220/2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Substitute into Kc = [NO2]^2/[N2O4] from the provided equilibrium expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 7.36×10^-2, reported as dimensionless.",

    "Concentrations are realistic for the given moles in 2.00 dm3.",
