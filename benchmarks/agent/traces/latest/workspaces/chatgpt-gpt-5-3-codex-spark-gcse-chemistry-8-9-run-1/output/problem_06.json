    "value": 0.0736,
    "units": "dimensionless",
    "precision_note": "Calculated directly from molar concentrations using the given equilibrium expression, with 3 significant figures."
  },
  "method": "Convert moles to molar concentrations using vessel volume 2.00 dm3. [NO2] = 0.180/2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm^-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220/2.00 = 0.110 mol dm^-3. The equilibrium expression is Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Substituting gives Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0736. As stated in the constants, Kc is reported as unitless.",
  "key_equations": [
    "c = n / V",
    "Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]",
    "Kc is unitless"
  ],
  "line_refs": ["L20", "L56", "L57", "L58"],
  "checks": [
    "NO2 concentration is squared because reaction produces 2NO2 per N2O4.",
    "Using 2.00 dm3 volume in both concentrations keeps unit consistency.",
    "Kc value is dimensionless according to the provided instruction in the constants list."
