  },
  "method": "Use the bond-energy estimate formula \\DeltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). For CH4 + 2O2, broken bonds are 4 C-H at 413 kJ mol^-1 and 2 O=O at 498 kJ mol^-1: E_broken = 4(413)+2(498)=2648 kJ mol^-1. Formed bonds are in CO2 (2 C=O at 805 each) and 2H2O (4 O-H at 463 each): E_formed = 2(805)+4(463)=3462 kJ mol^-1. Therefore \\DeltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol^-1.",

    "\\Delta H = \\Sigma E_{broken} - \\Sigma E_{formed}",

    "Reaction has 4 C-H and 2 O=O bonds broken, matching reactants CH4 and 2O2.",

    "Negative sign is expected for a combustion reaction and indicates heat released."
