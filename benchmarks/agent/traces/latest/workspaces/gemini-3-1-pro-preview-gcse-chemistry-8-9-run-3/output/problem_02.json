  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, find the moles of CaCO3 by dividing its mass by its molar mass (Mr = 100.1): 4.20 / 100.1 = 0.041958 mol. From the balanced reaction equation, 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CO2, so 0.041958 mol of CO2 is produced. Finally, multiply the moles of CO2 by its molar mass (Mr = 44.0) to find the maximum mass of CO2 produced: 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 1.846 g. Rounding to three significant figures yields 1.85 g.",
