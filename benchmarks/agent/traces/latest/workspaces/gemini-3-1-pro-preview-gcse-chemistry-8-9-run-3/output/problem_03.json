  "method": "First, find the moles of NaOH used in the titration using the formula n = c * V. Substituting the given values: n = 0.150 mol dm-3 * (23.40 / 1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. According to the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH, so the moles of H2SO4 is exactly half of the moles of NaOH: 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4 by dividing the moles by its volume in dm3: c = n / V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00 / 1000) dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
