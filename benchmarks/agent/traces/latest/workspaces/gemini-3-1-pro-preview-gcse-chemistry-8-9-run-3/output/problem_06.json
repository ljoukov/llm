  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentration of each gas by dividing the number of moles by the volume of the reaction vessel (2.00 dm3). The concentration of NO2 is 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. The concentration of N2O4 is 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Next, substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction. The expression is Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Substituting the values gives Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.073636. Rounding to three significant figures, the equilibrium constant is 0.0736. As per instructions, the unit is reported as dimensionless.",
