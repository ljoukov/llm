  "headline": "JWST Data Suggests Presence of Atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have found evidence that the Earth-sized planet TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere. By observing the planet's heat signatures and spectral characteristics as it orbits its star, researchers found that the planet redistributes heat in a way that is inconsistent with a bare rock. Specifically, the data shows a heat transport efficiency and spectral absorption around 15 micrometers that points toward a CO2-rich or O2-rich atmosphere, although the exact composition remains unconfirmed. This finding is significant because TRAPPIST-1 b is a rocky planet orbiting a small star, and whether such planets can keep their atmospheres is a major question in astrobiology.",
