  "headline": "JWST Finds Evidence of an Atmosphere on Earth-Sized Rocky Planet TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have analyzed the thermal emission from TRAPPIST-1 b, a rocky planet orbiting a nearby red dwarf star. By observing how the planet's heat varies as it orbits its star (a 'phase curve') and measuring its spectrum, they found evidence that the planet is likely not just a bare rock. The data suggests that heat is being moved from the permanent day side to the night side, possibly by an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide. While the presence of an atmosphere is suggested by the combined data, the exact composition and pressure of this atmosphere remain uncertain. This discovery is a significant step in understanding whether rocky planets orbiting small, cool stars can maintain atmospheres despite intense stellar radiation.",

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The current study is limited to a single planet and may not apply to all similar rocky worlds.",
    "Uncertainties in stellar variability and instrument performance could influence the weak spectral signals observed.",
    "Atmospheric models are sensitive to assumptions about clouds, hazes, and heat circulation patterns."
