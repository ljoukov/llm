The retrieved results favor some day–night heat redistribution (a non-zero heat transport efficiency) and show spectral behavior consistent with atmospheric absorption, which together makes a strictly bare-rock, no-atmosphere interpretation harder to reconcile with all of the data at once. In joint fits, atmosphere-bearing models are preferred over a no-atmosphere model.

Quantitative values (dayside brightness temperature 342±22 K, epsilon 0.19 +0.23/-0.14, Bond albedo <0.08, 15 µm band depth 96 ppm, likelihood ratio 7.4, and CO2-rich pressure scale 0.3–1.0 bar) match the report’s table and are correctly referenced (L27–L32). Core qualitative findings are covered without overstatement: non-zero redistribution favored (L28, L41), spectral structure consistent with CO2-band absorption (L效"
