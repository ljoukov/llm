  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized rocky planet that likely keeps the same face toward its star, raising the question of whether it can hold onto any air under intense irradiation. In this study, researchers used JWST’s MIRI instrument to measure the planet’s thermal emission across its orbit (a phase curve) and looked for spectral structure around the 15 um CO2 band. The retrieved dayside brightness temperature is 342 +/- 22 K, and the analysis favors non-zero day–night heat transport (epsilon = 0.19 with uncertainties), which is not expected in the strict no-atmosphere limit. The best-fitting energy-balance solutions also imply the planet is very dark (Bond albedo < 0.08). In the spectrum, a feature near 15 um has an estimated depth of 96 ppm, consistent with atmospheric absorption rather than a perfectly flat spectrum. Overall, the joint fit favors atmosphere-bearing models over a no-atmosphere model (likelihood ratio 7.4), but the authors emphasize that composition and pressure remain uncertain; in CO2-rich model families, moderate pressures of about 0.3–1.0 bar remain plausible.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "JWST MIRI low-resolution phase-curve spectroscopy was used to test airless versus atmosphere-bearing models for TRAPPIST-1 b.",
    "The retrieval favors non-zero heat redistribution, with epsilon reported as 0.19 (+0.23 / -0.14) rather than 0.0.",
    "A 15 um spectral structure (estimated 96 ppm depth) and a joint likelihood ratio of 7.4 both favor atmosphere-bearing scenarios."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This is a single-planet study and does not show how common atmospheres are on similar rocky planets.",
    "Model retrieval results depend on assumptions about circulation, opacities, and clouds/hazes, creating important degeneracies.",
    "Weak spectral features can be biased by stellar variability or instrument systematics, and night-side constraints are weaker."
