  "method": "Convert time to seconds: 30.0 min * 60 = 1800 s. Calculate charge Q = I * t = 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C. Calculate moles of electrons n(e-) = Q / F = 2700 / 96500 = 0.027979 mol. From half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, 2 moles of electrons produce 1 mole of Cu. So n(Cu) = 0.027979 / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Mass of Cu = n * Ar = 0.01399 * 63.55 = 0.889 g.",
