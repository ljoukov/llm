  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, calculate the moles of CaCO3 using n = m / Mr: n(CaCO3) = 4.20 / 100.1 = 0.041958 mol. From the reaction stoichiometry (CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O), the ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1. Therefore, moles of CO2 = 0.041958 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2: m = n * Mr = 0.041958 * 44.0 = 1.846 g (to 3 s.f.).",
