  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, we substitute the known values: c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3, V1 = 25.0 cm3, and V2 = 250.0 cm3. Rearranging for c2 gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. Since the dilution factor is 10 (250/25), the concentration decreases by a factor of 10.",
