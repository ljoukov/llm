  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH used: n = c * V = 0.150 mol dm-3 * (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Thus, moles of H2SO4 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Calculate concentration of H2SO4: c = n / V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Since 2 moles NaOH react with 1 mole H2SO4, and volumes are similar, conc of H2SO4 should be roughly half of NaOH conc.",
