  "method": "Time is 30.0 min = 1800 s, so total charge passed is Q = It = 1.50 x 1800 = 2700 C. Moles of electrons are n(e-) = Q/F = 2700/96500 = 0.02798 mol. From Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, two moles of electrons deposit one mole of copper, so n(Cu) = 0.02798/2 = 0.01399 mol. Using Cu molar mass 63.55 g mol^-1, mass deposited is m = n x Mr = 0.01399 x 63.55 = 0.8889 g, giving 0.888 g.",
