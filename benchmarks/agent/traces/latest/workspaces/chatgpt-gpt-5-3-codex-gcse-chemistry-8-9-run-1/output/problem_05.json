  },
  "method": "Convert time: 30.0 min = 1800 s, so charge passed is 2700 C from 1.50 A over that interval. From Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, two moles of electrons deposit one mole of copper. Using F = 96500 C mol-1 gives n(Cu) = 2700/(2 x 96500) = 0.01399 mol. Multiply by Cu molar mass 63.55 to get m = 0.01399 x 63.55 = 0.889 g.",

    "n(Cu) = Q/(2F)",

    "Doubling either current or time would double deposited mass, matching electrolysis proportionality.",
    "Result is less than 1 g for a moderate current over 30 minutes, which is physically plausible."
