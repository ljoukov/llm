  "method": "Current is 1.50 A for 30.0 min, so time in seconds is t = 30.0×60 = 1800 s and charge passed is Q = I×t = 1.50×1800 = 2700 C. Faraday constant F = 96,500 C mol-1 means 96,500 C corresponds to 1 mol of electrons, so n(e−) = 2700/96500 = 0.02798 mol e−. From the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu, 2 mol e− deposit 1 mol Cu, so n(Cu) = 0.02798/2 = 0.01399 mol. Using the given atomic mass of copper (63.55 g mol-1), m(Cu) = 0.01399×63.55 = 0.890 g, which rounds to 0.890 g (3 s.f.).",
