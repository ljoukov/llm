  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH first: n = cV with V in dm3, so V(NaOH) = 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3 and n(NaOH) = 0.150 x 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol. From H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, 2 mol NaOH react with 1 mol H2SO4, so n(H2SO4) = 0.00351/2 = 0.001755 mol. The acid volume is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3, so c(H2SO4) = n/V = 0.001755/0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm^-3.",
