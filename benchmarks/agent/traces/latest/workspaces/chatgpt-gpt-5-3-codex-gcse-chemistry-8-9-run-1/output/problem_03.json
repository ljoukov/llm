  "method": "Convert NaOH volume to dm3: 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3. Moles of NaOH used are n = cV = 0.150 x 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol. From H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, 2 mol NaOH react with 1 mol H2SO4, so n(H2SO4)=0.00351/2=0.001755 mol. Acid volume is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3, hence c(H2SO4)=n/V=0.001755/0.02500=0.0702 mol dm-3.",
