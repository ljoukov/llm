  "method": "Use the neutralization stoichiometry H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O. Moles NaOH used are 0.150 x 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol. Therefore moles H2SO4 = 0.00351/2 = 0.001755 mol. The acid volume is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3, so concentration is c = n/V = 0.001755/0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Because 2 mol NaOH react with 1 mol H2SO4, acid moles must be half the base moles.",
    "Computed acid concentration is below base concentration, reasonable with similar titration volumes and 2:1 stoichiometry."
