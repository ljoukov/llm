  "method": "Use Kc = [NO2]^2/[N2O4]. The equilibrium vessel volume is 2.00 dm3, with moles NO2 = 0.180 and moles N2O4 = 0.220. So [NO2] = 0.180/2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm^-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220/2.00 = 0.110 mol dm^-3. Then Kc = (0.0900)^2/0.110 = 0.00810/0.110 = 0.0736. As instructed, this is reported without units.",
