  "method": "Use Kc = [NO2]^2/[N2O4]. Convert given equilibrium moles to concentrations using the 2.00 dm3 vessel: [NO2] = 0.180/2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220/2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Then Kc = (0.0900^2)/0.110 = 0.00810/0.110 = 0.0736. As instructed, report Kc without units.",

  "checks": [
    "Kc is positive and dimensionless, consistent with the provided reporting instruction.",
    "Since concentrations are below 0.2 mol dm-3, a Kc value below 1 is numerically reasonable here."
