  "method": "Use Kc = [NO2]^2/[N2O4]. Convert moles to concentrations by dividing by the vessel volume 2.00 dm3: [NO2] = 0.180/2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220/2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Substitute into the expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2/0.110 = 0.00810/0.110 = 0.0736 (reported unitless as requested).",
