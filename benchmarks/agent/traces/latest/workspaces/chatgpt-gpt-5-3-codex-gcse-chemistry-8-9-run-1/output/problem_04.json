    "value": -814,
    "units": "kJ mol-1",
    "precision_note": "Bond energies are tabulated as integers, so reporting deltaH to the nearest kJ mol-1 is suitable."
  },
  "method": "Use deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). For reactants in CH4 + 2O2, bonds broken are 4(C-H) + 2(O=O) = 4(413) + 2(498) = 2648 kJ mol-1. For products CO2 + 2H2O, bonds formed are 2(C=O in CO2) + 4(O-H) = 2(805) + 4(463) = 3462 kJ mol-1. Therefore deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1, indicating an exothermic combustion estimate.",

    "Negative sign is expected for combustion because more energy is released forming product bonds.",
    "Bond counts match balanced equation: 4 C-H and 2 O=O broken; 2 C=O and 4 O-H formed."
