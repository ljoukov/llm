When combined with ICI therapy, this led to better tumor control. The researchers also looked at data from human cancer patients and found that those who had received a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine appeared to have better survival rates when treated with ICIs. However, this human data is from a look-back (retrospective) study, which can't prove cause and effect.
