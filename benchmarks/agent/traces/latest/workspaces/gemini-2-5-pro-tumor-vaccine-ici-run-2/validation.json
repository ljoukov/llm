        "public_summary.json adds an unsupported caveat: \"The timing and type of mRNA vaccine used in the human patients were not controlled\". The report supports timing variability (L50) but does not mention vaccine type not being controlled; this is partially fabricated/over-interpreted beyond the report.",
        "Several key claims across outputs (especially claim_audit.json) are not accompanied by valid line-referenced caveats where needed; e.g., C01 uses strength=\"strong\" for an overall sensitization conclusion without explicitly tying to the major human-causality limitations (L49-L52) in the evidence block. While a caveat is present, the strength label is arguably too assertive given the retrospective human evidence.",
        "Line-referencing requirement is not met uniformly: study_overview.json and quantitative_findings.json are grounded, but public_summary.json provides no line references at all, and the task requires valid mappings to numbered report lines."

However, public_summary.json is schema-invalid and ungrounded, and it introduces at least one clear unsupported/overstated claim (\"first study\") plus an extra caveat not stated in the report (vaccine type not controlled). Because the pass criteria require no"
