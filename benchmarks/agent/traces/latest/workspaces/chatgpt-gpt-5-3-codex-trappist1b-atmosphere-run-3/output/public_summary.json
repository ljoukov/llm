  "headline": "JWST phase-curve data hint that TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a small, rocky planet that likely keeps the same side facing its star. Researchers used JWST’s MIRI instrument to watch how the planet’s infrared glow changes through its orbit (a “phase curve”) and to look for telltale patterns in the spectrum near 15 microns, where carbon dioxide can absorb light. They find that models with some heat transport from day to night and with atmospheric absorption can explain the data better than a strictly airless, bare-rock planet. However, the exact composition and surface pressure of any atmosphere are still uncertain, and the authors stress that additional observations at more wavelengths and repeated measurements are needed to confirm and refine the picture.",

    "This is a single-planet analysis and may not generalize to other rocky exoplanets.",
    "Retrieval results depend on model assumptions about circulation, opacity priors, and clouds/hazes.",
