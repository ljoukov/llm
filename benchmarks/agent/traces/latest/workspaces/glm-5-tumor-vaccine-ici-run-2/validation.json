        "The claim_audit.json file is explicitly marked groundingValid:false, and the validator reports multiple evidence quotes (C01–C06) that are not found verbatim in the report. Because this task requires valid line-referenced grounding, these non-verbatim/constructed quotes make the audit unreliable for downstream review (e.g., quotes like “Type I interferon response score (normalized units): 3.1 vs 1.0” are not present as an exact sentence in L31).",
        "public_summary.json overstates a comparative result not directly stated in the provided report: it claims the combination “showed better tumor control in mice than either treatment alone.” The report only states that the “Combined intervention improves tumor control in mice” (L46) and separately that vaccine-only and ICI-only had limitations (L36–L37), but it does not explicitly assert a direct head-to-head superiority statement in the summarized lines.",
        "Several claim_audit.json strength ratings are set to “strong” even when the provided report framing is more mechanistic-proposal/chain than definitive causal proof in all contexts (L41–L46, plus caveat that effects/readouts were model-dependent in L53). This calibration issue is smaller than the grounding failure but still reduces reliability."

      "summary": "The overview and quantitative_findings JSONs are largely faithful to the report’s cohorts, key numbers, controls, and caveats (L14–L23, L28–L33, L36–L53). However, the overall output set fails because claim_audit.json does not meet grounding requirements (evidence quotes are not actually present verbatim in the cited lines per the provided validation errors), undermining traceability. Additionally, the public summary includes at least one comparative efficacy statement not explicitly supported ("
