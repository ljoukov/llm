In mouse experiments, combining mRNA vaccines with anti-PD-L1 therapy led to better tumor control. The study also analyzed 130 cancer patients who received immunotherapy, comparing those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination with those who had not. Vaccinated patients showed better survival outcomes. However, this human analysis was retrospective, meaning researchers looked back at existing data rather than conducting a controlled experiment.
