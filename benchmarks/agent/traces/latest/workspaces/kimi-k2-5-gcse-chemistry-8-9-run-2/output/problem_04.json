  "method": "Calculate enthalpy change using deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). For the reaction CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O: Bonds broken in reactants: 4 C-H bonds (4 × 413 = 1652 kJ mol-1) and 2 O=O bonds (2 × 498 = 996 kJ mol-1), total = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed in products: 2 C=O bonds in CO2 (2 × 805 = 1610 kJ mol-1) and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O (4 × 463 = 1852 kJ mol-1), total = 3462 kJ mol-1. Therefore, deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative value indicates an exothermic reaction, which is expected for combustion.",
