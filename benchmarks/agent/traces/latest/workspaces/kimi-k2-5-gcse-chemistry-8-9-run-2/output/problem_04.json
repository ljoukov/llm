  "method": "Using deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). Bonds broken in reactants: CH4 has 4 C-H bonds (4 × 413 = 1652 kJ) and 2O2 has 2 O=O bonds (2 × 498 = 996 kJ). Total bonds broken = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ. Bonds formed in products: CO2 has 2 C=O bonds (2 × 805 = 1610 kJ) and 2H2O has 4 O-H bonds (4 × 463 = 1852 kJ). Total bonds formed = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ. Therefore deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative value indicates an exothermic reaction, consistent with combustion.",
