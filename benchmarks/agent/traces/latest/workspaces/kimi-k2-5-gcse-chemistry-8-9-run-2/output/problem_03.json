  "method": "First calculate moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = c × V = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2, so moles of H2SO4 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. The concentration of H2SO4 is calculated using c = n/V: c(H2SO4) = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3. The answer is given to 3 significant figures consistent with the input data precision.",
