  "method": "First calculate moles of NaOH: n = c × V = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio is 1:2 (acid:base). Therefore moles of H2SO4 = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. The concentration of H2SO4 is c = n/V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
