  "method": "First calculate equilibrium concentrations by dividing moles by volume. [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Apply the equilibrium expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The equilibrium constant is reported as dimensionless (unitless) as specified.",
