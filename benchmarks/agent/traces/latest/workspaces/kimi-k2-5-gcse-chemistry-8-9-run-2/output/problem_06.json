  "method": "Calculate equilibrium concentrations by dividing moles by volume: [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3, [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Apply the equilibrium constant expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The result is reported as dimensionless (unitless) as specified in the problem. The equilibrium favors the reactant (N2O4) side as Kc < 1.",
