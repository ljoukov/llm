  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 is the initial concentration, V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume. The initial HCl solution has concentration 0.200 mol dm-3 and volume 25.0 cm3. After dilution to 250.0 cm3, the new concentration is calculated as c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 × 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. Since all given values have 3 significant figures, the answer is reported to 3 significant figures.",
