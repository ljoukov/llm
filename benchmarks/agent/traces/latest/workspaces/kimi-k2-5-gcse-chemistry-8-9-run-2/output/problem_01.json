  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2. The initial concentration is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume is 25.0 cm3. The final volume is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging gives c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration decreases by a factor of 10 because the volume increases by a factor of 10.",

    "Units are correct: mol dm-3 is the standard unit for concentration"
