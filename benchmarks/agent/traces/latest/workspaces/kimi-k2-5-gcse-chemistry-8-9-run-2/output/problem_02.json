  "method": "First calculate the mass of pure CaCO3: 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Then calculate moles of CaCO3 using n = m/Mr: 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 = 0.04196 mol. From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so moles of CO2 = 0.04196 mol. Finally calculate mass of CO2: 0.04196 mol × 44.0 g mol-1 = 1.846 g, which rounds to 1.85 g to 3 significant figures.",
