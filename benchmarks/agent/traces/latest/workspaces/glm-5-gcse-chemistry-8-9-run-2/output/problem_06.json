  "method": "For the equilibrium N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g), Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. First calculate equilibrium concentrations: [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3, and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Substitute into the Kc expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. As instructed, Kc is reported as dimensionless (unitless).",

    "Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810/0.110 = 0.0736 confirms the calculation."
