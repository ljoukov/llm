Total bonds broken = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ. For bonds formed: CO2 has 2 C=O bonds (2 × 805 = 1610 kJ) and 2 H2O molecules have 4 O-H bonds (4 × 463 = 1852 kJ). Total bonds formed = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ. Apply ΔH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed) = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative value indicates an exothermic reaction.",
