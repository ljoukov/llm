  "method": "This is a dilution problem using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2. The initial concentration of HCl is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume transferred is 25.0 cm3. The final volume after dilution is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging the dilution equation: c2 = c1V1/V2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 x 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration is reduced by a factor of 10, which matches the volume increase from 25.0 cm3 to 250.0 cm3.",

    "The dilution factor is 250.0/25.0 = 10, so the concentration should decrease by a factor of 10 from 0.200 to 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
