  "method": "Apply the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2 to find the new concentration after dilution. The initial concentration is 0.200 mol dm-3 with volume 25.0 cm3. After dilution to a final volume of 250.0 cm3, rearrange to solve for c2: c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration decreases by a factor of 10, consistent with a tenfold increase in volume.",

    "Dilution factor is 250.0/25.0 = 10, so concentration should be 0.200/10 = 0.0200 mol dm-3, which matches the calculated result.",
