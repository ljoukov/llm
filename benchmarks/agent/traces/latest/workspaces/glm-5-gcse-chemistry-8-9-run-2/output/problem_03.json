  "method": "First calculate moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = c × V = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Therefore n(H2SO4) = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. This amount was in 25.00 cm3 of solution, so the concentration is c(H2SO4) = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "n = c × V",

    "Moles of NaOH = 0.150 × 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol, consistent with the titration data.",

    "Concentration = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3, verified by rearrangement."
