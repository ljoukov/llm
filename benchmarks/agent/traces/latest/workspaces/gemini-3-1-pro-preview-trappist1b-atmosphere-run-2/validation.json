Since the planet is very close to its star, scientists previously wondered if its atmosphere had been completely stripped away by intense radiation. By measuring how the planet's temperature changes as it orbits its star—and by looking at specific colors of infrared light—the researchers found evidence that the planet might still hold onto an atmosphere. The data shows that heat is being moved from the day side to the night side, something a bare rock cannot easily do. Additionally, they detected signs consistent with carbon dioxide absorbing light. While this does not prove the planet is habitable or exactly what the atmosphere is made of, it provides the strongest hint yet that TRAPPIST-1 b is not a completely airless world.\",\n  \"what_is_new\": [\n    \"JWST data reveals that TRAPPIST-1 b transports heat from its day side to its night side, suggesting the presence of an atmosphere.\",\n    \"A spectral feature around 15 micrometers was detected, which is consistent with the absorption of light by carbon dioxide.\",\n    \"Joint analysis of temperature variations and spectral data shows that an atmosphere model is 7.4 times more likely than a bare-rock model.\"\n  ],\n  \"why_caution_is_needed\": [\n    \"The observations only cover a single planet, meaning we cannot assume other similar planets also have atmospheres.\",\n    \"Measurements are still uncertain, and the exact atmospheric composition or thickness could be different from the models tested.\",\n    \"Variability from the star itself or minor instrument errors could mimic or interfere with the weak atmospheric signals.\"\n  ],\n  \"glossary\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Phase curve\",\n      \"definition\": \"The variation in brightness as a planet orbits its star, revealing temperature differences between its day and night sides.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Bare-rock model\",\n      \"definition\": \"A theoretical scenario where a planet has no atmosphere, meaning it cannot easily move heat from its day side to its night side.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"M dwarf\",\n      \"definition\": \"A small, cool, and dim star that is the most common type of star in our galaxy, like the one TRAPPIST-1 b orbits.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Heat transport efficiency\",\n      \"definition\": \"A measure of how well a planet's atmosphere or surface can distribute heat around the globe.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"open_questions\": [\n    \"What is the exact chemical composition of TRAPPIST-1 b's atmosphere, and could it be dominated by oxygen instead of carbon dioxide?\",\n    \"How thick or dense is this potential atmosphere, and does it contain clouds or hazes that mask other features?\",\n    \"Are the other Earth-sized planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system also able to retain their atmospheres despite stellar radiation?\"\n  ]\n}"
