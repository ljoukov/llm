  "headline": "mRNA vaccine boosts tumor response to checkpoint inhibitors in mice and hints at human benefit",
  "plain_language_summary": "The study shows that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumours creates a strong interferon‑driven immune environment that expands the range of tumour antigens presented on MHC‑I molecules. In mouse models this leads to higher PD‑L1 expression and greater infiltration of CD8+ T‑cells, which together make anti‑PD‑L1 therapy more effective. A retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic cancer patients suggests that those who had previously received a SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA vaccine survived longer when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the human findings are observational, and the mechanistic data come from specific mouse tumour models, so further prospective trials are needed before clinical adoption.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Intratumoral mRNA vaccination expands the tumor immunopeptidome, increasing antigen presentation on MHC‑I.",
    "The vaccine induces a strong type I interferon response that raises PD‑L1 expression and CD8+ T‑cell density within tumours.",
    "Retrospective human data indicate improved survival for patients previously vaccinated with SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA vaccines undergoing ICI therapy."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "Human results are derived from a retrospective, non‑randomized cohort, so confounding factors may influence survival outcomes.",
    "Timing of vaccination relative to checkpoint inhibitor initiation varied among patients, limiting direct comparability.",
    "Mouse model effects may not translate uniformly to the heterogeneity of human cancers and treatment histories."
