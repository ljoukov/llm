        "output/claim_audit.json is explicitly not grounded: it contains “quotes” that are not verbatim present at the cited line references (validationErrors for C01, C02). This breaks the requirement that line references map to the report lines and undermines traceability.",
        "claim_audit uses interpreted paraphrases as if they were direct textual evidence (e.g., “Broader antigen display after intratumoral mRNA vaccination”, “Strong expansion of MHC‑I‑presented landscape”), but in the report those phrases appear as the table’s “Interpretation” column rather than quoted statements; presenting them as quotes is misleading.",
        "Calibration/overstatement risk in claim_audit: C01 labels the sensitization conclusion as “strong”, but the report frames the overall clinical relevance cautiously (retrospective human cohort; prospective randomized studies required; L48-L56). A “strong” strength label is not well-aligned with these caveats.",
        "claim_audit introduces details not stated in the report, reducing faithfulness: e.g., “direct measurement in patients was not performed” (C04 caveat) is plausible but not supported by any report line; “functional impact … remains to be quantified” (C05 caveat) is also not grounded in the provided report text.",

However, claim_audit.json fails the grader’s traceability requirements by using non-verbatim “quotes” that do not exist at the cited line numbers and by adding unsupported caveats. It also overstates evidence strength given the retrospective, non-randomized human component and stated validity threats. As"
