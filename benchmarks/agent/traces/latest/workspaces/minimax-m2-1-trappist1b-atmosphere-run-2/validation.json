This finding is significant because many scientists had doubted whether such planets could retain any atmospheric envelope under the harsh conditions typical of M dwarf star systems. The study examined how the planet's thermal emission changes as it orbits its star, creating a 'phase curve' that reveals how heat is distributed across the dayside and nightside. The data suggest that some mechanism is transporting heat around the planet, which would not happen on a bare, airless rock. Additionally, subtle spectral signatures at a specific infrared wavelength hint at the possible presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
