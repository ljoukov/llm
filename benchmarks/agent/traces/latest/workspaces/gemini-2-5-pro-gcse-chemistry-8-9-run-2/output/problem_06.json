    "method": "First, the equilibrium concentrations of NO2 and N2O4 are calculated by dividing the number of moles of each substance by the volume of the vessel in dm3. Then, the equilibrium constant, Kc, is calculated using the expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. The value is reported without units as specified in the report.",
