    "method": "The enthalpy change of the reaction is estimated by calculating the difference between the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds in the products. For the reactants (CH4 and 2O2), this involves breaking 4 C-H bonds and 2 O=O bonds. For the products (CO2 and 2H2O), this involves forming 2 C=O bonds and 4 O-H bonds. The total energy for bonds broken is subtracted from the total energy for bonds formed.",
