    "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) is calculated using the formula: deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). First, calculate the energy absorbed to break bonds: 4 C-H bonds (4 * 413 kJ/mol) and 2 O=O bonds (2 * 498 kJ/mol), totaling 2648 kJ/mol. Next, calculate the energy released when forming bonds: 2 C=O bonds (2 * 805 kJ/mol) and 4 O-H bonds (4 * 463 kJ/mol), totaling 3462 kJ/mol. Finally, deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
