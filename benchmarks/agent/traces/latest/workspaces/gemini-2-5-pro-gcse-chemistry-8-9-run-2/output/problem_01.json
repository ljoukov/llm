    "method": "The dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2 is used. First, the initial volume in cm3 is converted to dm3 by dividing by 1000 (25.0 cm3 = 0.0250 dm3). Then, the equation is rearranged to solve for the final concentration, c2: c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the given values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 0.0250 dm3) / 0.250 dm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
