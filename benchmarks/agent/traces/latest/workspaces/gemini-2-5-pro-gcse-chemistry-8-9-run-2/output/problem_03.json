    "method": "First, the moles of NaOH used in the titration are calculated using the formula n = c * V. The volume of NaOH is converted from cm3 to dm3. The stoichiometry of the reaction H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O is 1:2, so the moles of H2SO4 are half the moles of NaOH. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 is calculated by dividing the moles of H2SO4 by its volume in dm3.",
