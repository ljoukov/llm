    "method": "First, calculate the moles of NaOH used in the titration: n(NaOH) = c * V = 0.150 mol dm-3 * (23.40 cm3 / 1000) = 0.00351 mol. According to the reaction stoichiometry (H2SO4 + 2NaOH), the mole ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Therefore, the moles of H2SO4 is half the moles of NaOH: 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4: c(H2SO4) = n / V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00 cm3 / 1000) = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
