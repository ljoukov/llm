    "method": "First, the mass of pure CaCO3 in the limestone sample is calculated by multiplying the total mass by the purity percentage. Then, the moles of CaCO3 are calculated using the formula n = m / Mr. The stoichiometry of the reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O is 1:1 for CaCO3 and CO2, so the moles of CO2 produced are equal to the moles of CaCO3 reacted. Finally, the mass of CO2 is calculated by multiplying the moles of CO2 by its molar mass.",
