    "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g * (84.0 / 100) = 4.20 g. Next, calculate the moles of CaCO3 using n = m / Mr: 4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.04196 mol. The reaction stoichiometry between CaCO3 and CO2 is 1:1, so the moles of CO2 produced is also 0.04196 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 using m = n * Mr: 0.04196 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 1.846 g. The result is rounded to 3 significant figures.",
