    "method": "First, the time is converted from minutes to seconds. The total charge passed is calculated using Q = I * t. Then, the moles of electrons are determined using n(e-) = Q / F, with F being the Faraday constant. According to the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper, so the moles of copper are half the moles of electrons. Finally, the mass of copper deposited is calculated by multiplying the moles of copper by its atomic mass.",
