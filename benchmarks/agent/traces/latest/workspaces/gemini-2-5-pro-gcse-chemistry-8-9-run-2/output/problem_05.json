    "method": "First, calculate the total charge passed using Q = I * t, converting time to seconds: Q = 1.50 A * (30.0 min * 60 s/min) = 2700 C. Then, find the moles of electrons using n(e-) = Q / F: 2700 C / 96500 C/mol = 0.02798 mol. From the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, the mole ratio of electrons to copper is 2:1, so moles of Cu = 0.02798 mol / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of copper deposited: m = n * Mr = 0.01399 mol * 63.55 g/mol = 0.889 g.",
