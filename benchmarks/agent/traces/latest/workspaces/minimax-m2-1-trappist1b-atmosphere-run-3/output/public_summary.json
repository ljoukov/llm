  "headline": "JWST observations detect signs of an atmosphere on the rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 b, suggesting some planets around small stars may retain air despite harsh stellar radiation",
  "plain_language_summary": "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have found the best evidence yet that a small, rocky world orbiting a cool star can hold onto an atmosphere. TRAPPIST-1 b is a planet roughly Earth's size that circles its host star much closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. For years, scientists have debated whether such planets would lose their protective air blankets to intense stellar radiation. The new study analyzes how the planet's heat changes as it rotates, revealing patterns that suggest something more than bare rock is present - likely an atmosphere that can move heat from the day side to the night side. The detection is not definitive, but the evidence points away from a completely airless world and toward something with at least a thin atmosphere, possibly containing carbon dioxide gas. This finding matters because understanding which rocky planets can keep their atmospheres helps scientists assess where else in the universe conditions might be suitable for life.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "First detection of thermal phase-curve variations from JWST MIRI spectroscopy for TRAPPIST-1 b, providing simultaneous constraints on heat redistribution and atmospheric composition",
    "Evidence favoring an atmosphere with heat transport efficiency above the bare-rock limit, quantified at epsilon = 0.19 (+0.23/-0.14), suggesting day-night heat flow occurs beyond simple reradiation",
    "Statistical comparison showing atmosphere-bearing models fit the combined spectral and phase-curve data 7.4 times better than no-atmosphere models, representing moderate confidence in atmospheric detection"
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The atmospheric detection is moderate, not definitive - the likelihood ratio of 7.4 falls short of strong statistical thresholds used in astronomy for confirmed discoveries",
    "Degeneracies between atmospheric composition, cloud properties, and circulation patterns mean multiple different atmospheric scenarios could explain the data equally well",
    "Stellar variability from the active M dwarf host star and potential instrument systematics could mimic or obscure weak spectral features like the CO2 band detection",
