TRAPPIST-1 b is a planet roughly Earth's size that circles its host star much closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. For years, scientists have debated whether such planets would lose their protective air blankets to intense stellar radiation. The new study analyzes how the planet's heat changes as it rotates, revealing patterns that suggest something more than bare rock is present - likely an atmosphere that can move heat from the day side to the night side. The detection is not definitive, but the evidence points away from a completely airless world and toward something with at least a thin atmosphere, possibly containing carbon dioxide gas.

        "Two required deliverables are not practically usable due to invalid validation status: `output/public_summary.json` is not valid JSON (trailing comma in `why_caution_is_needed`, plus overall parse error), and `output/claim_audit.json` fails schema/grounding validation (claims.3.evidence has only 1 item, but schema expects >=2). These are hard failures for downstream review pipelines regardless of textual faithfulness.",
        "`output/public_summary.json` contains an ungrounded novelty claim: “First detection of thermal phase-curve variations from JWST MIRI spectroscopy for TRAPPIST-1 b”. The report describes JWST MIRI phase-curve spectroscopy being used (L10-L16) but does not claim this is the first such detection. This is an overreach beyond the provided source lines.",
        "Calibration/overstatement risk: `output/public_summary.json` headline says “detect signs of an atmosphere” and the summary says “best evidence yet” and implies the phase curve “revealing patterns that suggest something more than bare rock is present - likely an atmosphere”. The report is more cautious: evidence against a strictly airless interpretation, but composition/pressure uncertain and follow-up essential (L52-L53), with significant degeneracies and systematics concerns (L37, L49). The generated text trends toward stronger framing than supported.",
        "`output/claim_audit.json` Claim C01 concludes “indicating the presence of an atmosphere” from non-zero heat transport. The report’s mechanistic chain notes non-zero redistribution implies transport beyond bare-rock immediate reradiation (L41) and that evidence is against a strictly airless interpretation (L52-L53), but it does not state heat transport alone indicates an atmosphere definitively; degeneracies and uncertainties are emphasized (L37-L50). The claim’s wording is too definitive relative to the stated caveats.",
        "Interpretation drift in multiple places: both `quantitative_findings.json` (Q03 interpretation) and `claim_audit.json` (C04) add “suggesting rock-like surface properties” from low Bond albedo. The report states the planet appears very dark in thermal-energy balance fits (L29), but does not explicitly tie this to rock-like surface properties. This is plausibly true but not grounded in the provided lines."

However, the overall output set fails because (1) `public_summary.json` is invalid JSON and includes at least one ungrounded novelty claim plus somewhat overstated framing compared with the report’s caution (L37"
