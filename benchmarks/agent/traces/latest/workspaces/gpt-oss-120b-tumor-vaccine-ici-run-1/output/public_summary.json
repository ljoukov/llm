  "headline": "Intratumoral mRNA vaccines boost checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness but need human trials",
  "plain_language_summary": "The researchers tested whether delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into mouse tumors could make the tumours more visible to the immune system and therefore respond better to drugs that block the PD‑L1 checkpoint. In several mouse models the vaccine increased interferon signals, broadened the range of tumour proteins presented on MHC‑I molecules and raised PD‑L1 levels, leading to stronger tumour control when combined with anti‑PD‑L1 therapy. A retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic cancer patients showed that those who had received a SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA vaccine before starting checkpoint blockade survived longer (p=0.01). However, the human data are observational, the timing of vaccination varied, and mouse results may not translate to all human cancers. The study suggests a promising biological strategy but calls for prospective, randomised trials before clinical recommendations.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "mRNA vaccination directly inside tumours expands the immunopeptidome, exposing more tumour antigens to immune cells.",
    "Type I interferon response scores rise sharply after intratumoral mRNA vaccination, indicating potent innate activation.",
    "Retrospective human patients with prior SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA vaccination showed improved survival under checkpoint blockade (p=0.01)."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human survival benefit comes from a non‑randomised, retrospective cohort, which may be confounded by other factors.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to immunotherapy varied among patients, making causal inference uncertain.",
    "Mouse tumour models do not capture the full diversity of human cancers, so results may not be generalisable."
