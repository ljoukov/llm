These cancer drugs work by helping the immune system recognize and attack tumors, but they don't work well for all patients. In laboratory experiments with mice, researchers found that injecting mRNA directly into tumors created an inflammatory environment that boosted the immune response. The tumor cells displayed more proteins on their surface that immune cells could recognize as foreign, and more immune cells infiltrated the tumor. The researchers also looked at medical records of 130 cancer patients who received immunotherapy and found that those who had previously received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines tended to have better survival outcomes.
