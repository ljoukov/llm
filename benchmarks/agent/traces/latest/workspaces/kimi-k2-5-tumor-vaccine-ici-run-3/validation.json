In laboratory mice with cancer, injecting mRNA vaccines into tumors created a strong immune response that made the tumors more visible to the body's defense system. When combined with existing cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, this approach helped control tumor growth better than either treatment alone. The researchers also looked back at medical records of cancer patients who received immunotherapy and found that those who had previously received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines tended to have better survival outcomes. The mechanism appears to work through interferon, a natural immune signaling molecule that helps alert the immune system to the presence of cancer cells and increases the display of cancer markers on tumor cells.

        "The claim_audit.json file is not faithfully grounded to the provided report text because it presents multiple evidence “quotes” that are not verbatim present in the cited lines (explicitly flagged as groundingValid:false). Examples include: C01 evidence quote attributed to L11, C01 quote attributed to L31, C02 quotes attributed to L28/L29, C03 quote attributed to L30, and C04 quote attributed to L32. These strings combine metric names + numeric values + interpretations into a single quoted sentence that does not appear as-written in the report table (L26–L33). This violates the requirement that line references be valid and map to the numbered report lines in a usable way for downstream review.",
        "Several claim strengths are over-calibrated given the study design and stated caveats. In claim_audit.json, C01 and C02 are labeled “strong” even though the report emphasizes mouse-model mechanisms and explicitly cautions that effects may not map one-to-one to humans and that mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific models (L52–L53). For a mixed preclinical + retrospective paper, mechanistic statements may be strong in-mouse, but the overall ‘sensitizes tumors to ICB’ framing should be more carefully scoped to the preclinical setting and/or labeled moderate rather than blanket “strong.”",
        "public_summary.json contains mild overstatement relative to the report phrasing: it says the combination 'helped control tumor growth better than either treatment alone.' The report states that vaccine-only lacked durable control in non-immunogenic models (L36) and ICI-only had limited activity (L37), and that the combined intervention improves tumor control in mice (L46), but it does not explicitly state a direct head-to-head superiority claim in the narrative text provided. This is likely implied, but as a strict grader this is not tightly anchored to a specific line."

However, the set fails overall because claim_audit.json uses non-verbatim, table-synthesized ‘quotes’ that are not present as written in the cited report lines, making the evidence trail unreliable for downstream auditing. Additionally, several claim strength labels and one public-"
