This study tested whether delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor can create a local, interferon-driven inflammatory environment that makes tumors easier for immune cells to recognize and attack. In mouse tumor models, the authors report broader presentation of tumor peptides on MHC-I and increases in signals linked to immune activation, alongside increased PD-L1 pathway activity that could make anti-PD-L1 therapy more effective. The paper also includes a retrospective (non-randomized) analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with ICIs, where prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was associated with improved survival (p=0.01).
