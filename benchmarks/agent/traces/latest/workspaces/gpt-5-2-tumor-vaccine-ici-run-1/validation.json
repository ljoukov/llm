This study looked at whether delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumours can create a local interferon-driven immune activation that helps anti-PD-L1 therapy work better. In mouse tumour models, intratumoral mRNA vaccination was linked to stronger type I interferon signalling, broader antigen display (including a larger MHC-I peptidome), higher PD-L1 expression, and increased intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density. The paper also reports a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with ICIs, where outcomes differed by prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status (reported p=0.01).
