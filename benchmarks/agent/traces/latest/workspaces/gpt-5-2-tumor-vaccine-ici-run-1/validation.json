The paper also reports a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in which prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was associated with improved survival (p=0.01).

The study design is correctly characterized as preclinical mouse models plus a retrospective human cohort (L14–L16), and key mechanistic controls (non-mRNA lipid particles; IFNAR1 blockade) are covered"
