This study tests the idea that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor could create a strong local inflammatory signal (especially type I interferon), which in turn boosts how well tumors process and display antigens to the immune system. In mouse tumor models, the authors report that intratumoral mRNA vaccination broadens the MHC-I peptide repertoire and increases immune-related signals, including higher PD-L1 activity and increased CD8+ T-cell presence with combination treatment. The paper also includes a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with ICIs, where the vaccinated subgroup (43 patients) showed improved survival compared with the unvaccinated subgroup (87 patients), with a reported p-value of 0.01.
