This study asks whether delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumour can create a local, interferon-driven inflammatory state that makes the tumour more visible to immune cells and therefore more sensitive to anti-PD-L1 therapy (L11). In mouse tumour models, the authors report that intratumoral mRNA vaccination broadens the set of tumour proteins and peptides presented to the immune system (for example, 62.3% versus 37.3% of tumour proteins represented in an immunopeptidome comparison, and 40.6% versus 20.6% for the MHC-I peptidome; L28-L29). They also report increased markers linked to checkpoint biology and immune infiltration (for example, PD-L1 expression 2.4x and intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density 1.8x; L32-L33). In a separate, retrospective human cohort of metastatic patients treated with ICIs, prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was associated with improved survival (reported p=0.01; L30).
