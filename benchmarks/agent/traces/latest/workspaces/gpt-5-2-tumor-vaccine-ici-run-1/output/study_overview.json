    "Human analysis was retrospective and non-randomized, so residual confounding is likely.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients.",
    "Tumour-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity limits causal interpretation.",
    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumours.",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific models rather than uniform across settings."
