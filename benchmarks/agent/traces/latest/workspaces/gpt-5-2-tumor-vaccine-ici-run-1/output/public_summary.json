  "headline": "Study suggests mRNA vaccination inside tumors may boost response to checkpoint therapy",
  "plain_language_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors can work well for some cancers but fail when tumors are not well recognized by the immune system. This study reports that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors can trigger a strong type I interferon response (3.1 vs 1.0 normalized units) and broaden the peptides displayed to T cells (for example, 62.3% vs 37.3% of tumor proteins represented in the immunopeptidome). In mouse models, these changes are proposed to make tumors more sensitive to anti-PD-L1 therapy. The paper also describes a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients on checkpoint inhibitors in which the vaccinated subgroup showed improved survival (p=0.01), but the authors stress that this human evidence is non-randomized and could be confounded.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to broader antigen presentation in tumors, consistent with improved immune visibility.",
    "Connects an interferon-rich tumor state with increased PD-L1 activity, supporting a mechanistic rationale for combination therapy.",
    "Adds a retrospective human cohort comparison (130 total patients) suggesting better outcomes in vaccinated patients receiving ICI."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, so confounding factors could explain survival differences.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied, complicating interpretation of the observed association.",
    "Mouse model effects and mechanistic readouts may not generalize across all tumor types or clinical settings."
