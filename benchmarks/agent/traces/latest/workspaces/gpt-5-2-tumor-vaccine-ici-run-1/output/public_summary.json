  "headline": "Intratumoral mRNA vaccination may make tumors more responsive to checkpoint blockade",
  "plain_language_summary": "Many cancers do not respond well to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) because the tumour environment is not inflamed enough and tumour antigens are not presented strongly to the immune system. This study looked at whether delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumours can create a local interferon-driven immune activation that helps anti-PD-L1 therapy work better. In mouse tumour models, intratumoral mRNA vaccination was linked to stronger type I interferon signalling, broader antigen display (including a larger MHC-I peptidome), higher PD-L1 expression, and increased intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density. The paper also reports a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with ICIs, where outcomes differed by prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status (reported p=0.01). Because the human data are retrospective and non-randomized, the results should be treated as supportive but not proof that vaccination causes improved ICI benefit; prospective randomized studies are needed before changing clinical protocols.",

    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, so confounding could explain the association.",
    "Vaccination timing and patient/tumour heterogeneity limit direct causal interpretation.",

    "Some mechanistic signals were strongest only in specific model systems rather than uniformly."
