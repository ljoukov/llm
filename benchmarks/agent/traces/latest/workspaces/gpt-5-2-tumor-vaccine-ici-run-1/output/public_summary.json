  "headline": "Intratumoral mRNA vaccination may prime tumors to respond better to anti-PD-L1 therapy",
  "plain_language_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can lead to long-lasting cancer responses, but many tumors do not respond well. This study tests the idea that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor could create a strong local inflammatory signal (especially type I interferon), which in turn boosts how well tumors process and display antigens to the immune system. In mouse tumor models, the authors report that intratumoral mRNA vaccination broadens the MHC-I peptide repertoire and increases immune-related signals, including higher PD-L1 activity and increased CD8+ T-cell presence with combination treatment. The paper also includes a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with ICIs, where the vaccinated subgroup (43 patients) showed improved survival compared with the unvaccinated subgroup (87 patients), with a reported p-value of 0.01. Because the human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, the findings support a plausible biological hypothesis but do not yet justify changes to clinical practice without prospective randomized trials.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The work links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to an interferon-rich tumor state that can sensitize tumors to anti-PD-L1 therapy.",
    "It reports broader antigen presentation after vaccination, with higher fractions of proteins represented in the immunopeptidome and the MHC-I peptidome.",
    "It pairs preclinical mouse evidence with a retrospective human cohort comparison by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status during ICI treatment."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human survival comparison is retrospective and non-randomized, so residual confounding is likely.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied, and tumor types and prior treatments were heterogeneous.",
    "Mouse model results may not translate directly to all human tumors, and some mechanistic signals were strongest in specific settings."
