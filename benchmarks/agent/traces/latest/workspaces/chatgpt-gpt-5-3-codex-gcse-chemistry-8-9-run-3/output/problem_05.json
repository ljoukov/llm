  "method": "Convert time: 30.0 min = 1800 s. Charge passed is current × time: Q = 1.50 × 1800 = 2700 C. Using F = 96,500 C mol-1, the moles of electrons transferred are n(e−) = Q/96,500 = 2700/96,500 = 0.02798 mol e−. From Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu, 2 mol e− deposit 1 mol Cu, so n(Cu)=0.02798/2=0.01399 mol. With Ar(Cu)=63.55, mass deposited m = n×Ar = 0.01399×63.55 = 0.8886 g, which rounds to 0.889 g.",

    "Doubling current or time would double Q and therefore double the mass deposited; the method uses this proportionality.",
    "n(e−)≈0.028 mol gives n(Cu)≈0.014 mol; multiplying by ~64 g/mol gives just under 1 g, consistent with 0.889 g."
