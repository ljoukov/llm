  "method": "In this titration calculation, we determine the concentration of H2SO4 by neutralizing it with a known concentration and volume of NaOH. We are given 23.40 cm3 of 0.150 mol dm-3 NaOH. Using the formula n = c * V, the moles of NaOH = 0.150 mol dm-3 * (23.40 / 1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. The balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O indicates that 1 mole of sulfuric acid reacts with 2 moles of sodium hydroxide. Thus, the moles of H2SO4 required for neutralization is 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 is calculated using c = n / V, where V is 25.00 cm3 (or 0.02500 dm3). This gives a concentration of 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
