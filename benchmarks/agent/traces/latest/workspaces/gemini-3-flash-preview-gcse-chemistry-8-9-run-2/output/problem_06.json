  "method": "The equilibrium constant Kc for the dissociation of N2O4 into NO2 is determined from the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. The reaction is N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g), and the expression for Kc is [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. We are given that at equilibrium in a 2.00 dm3 vessel, there are 0.180 mol of NO2 and 0.220 mol of N2O4. We must first calculate the molar concentrations: [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Substituting these values into the Kc expression gives Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110. This calculates to 0.0081 / 0.110, which is approximately 0.073636. Following the instructions to report Kc as dimensionless and using three significant figures, the final value is 0.0736.",
