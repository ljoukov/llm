  "method": "To calculate the mass of copper deposited during electrolysis, we first determine the total charge (Q) passed through the circuit using Q = I * t. With a current I = 1.50 A and a time t = 30.0 minutes (which is 1800 seconds), Q = 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C. Next, we find the number of moles of electrons (n(e-)) using the Faraday constant (F = 96,500 C mol-1): n(e-) = 2700 C / 96,500 C mol-1 = 0.027979 mol. The half-equation at the cathode is Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, showing that 2 moles of electrons are needed to deposit 1 mole of copper. So, moles of Cu = 0.027979 mol / 2 = 0.0139896 mol. Finally, the mass of copper is calculated using m = n * Ar. With Ar(Cu) = 63.55, the mass is 0.0139896 mol * 63.55 g/mol = 0.88904 g, which rounds to 0.889 g.",
