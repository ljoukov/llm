  "method": "The problem asks for the maximum mass of CO2 produced from a 5.00 g limestone sample that is 84.0% CaCO3. First, we determine the mass of pure calcium carbonate in the sample: 5.00 g * 0.84 = 4.20 g. Next, we convert this mass to moles using the formula n = m / Mr. With the Mr of CaCO3 given as 100.1, the number of moles is 4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.041958 mol. The balanced chemical equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O shows a 1:1 molar ratio between CaCO3 and CO2. Therefore, the reaction produces 0.041958 mol of CO2. To find the mass of CO2, we multiply the number of moles by its Mr (44.0): 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 1.84615... g. Rounding to three significant figures, we get 1.85 g.",
