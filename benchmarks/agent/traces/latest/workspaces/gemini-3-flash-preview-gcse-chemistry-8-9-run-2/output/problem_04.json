  "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) for the combustion of methane is estimated using mean bond energies. The reaction equation is CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O. First, calculate the total energy required to break the bonds in the reactants: there are 4 C-H bonds in methane (4 * 413 kJ/mol) and 2 O=O bonds in oxygen (2 * 498 kJ/mol), totaling 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ/mol. Second, calculate the total energy released when new bonds are formed in the products: there are 2 C=O bonds in carbon dioxide (2 * 805 kJ/mol) and 4 O-H bonds in the two water molecules (4 * 463 kJ/mol), totaling 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ/mol. Using the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed), we get 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ/mol.",
