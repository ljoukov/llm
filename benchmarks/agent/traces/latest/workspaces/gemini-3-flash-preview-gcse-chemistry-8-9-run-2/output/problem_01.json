  "method": "To find the new concentration of HCl after dilution, we use the principle of conservation of moles, expressed by the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2. The technician starts with an initial volume V1 of 25.0 cm3 and an initial concentration c1 of 0.200 mol dm-3. This sample is then diluted to a final volume V2 of 250.0 cm3. Rearranging the equation to solve for the final concentration c2 gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. By substituting the known values into this equation, we get c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3. Performing the calculation: 0.200 * 25.0 = 5.00, and 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200. Thus, the new concentration of the HCl solution is 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
