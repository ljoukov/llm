The core idea is to deliver an mRNA vaccine directly into the tumor. This vaccine, similar to the COVID-19 vaccines, doesn't target tumor antigens but instead acts as an innate immune trigger. The research shows that this delivery creates a high-alert, interferon-rich environment within the tumor. This change causes the cancer cells to display a wider variety of their internal proteins on their surface (antigen presentation), essentially making the tumor 'more visible' to the immune system. Furthermore, this process upregulates key signaling molecules like PD-L1 and increases the infiltration of immune cells. Preclinical mouse models demonstrated that combining the mRNA injection with anti-PD-L1 therapy improved tumor control. This finding was supported by a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic cancer patients, where those who had received a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine prior to ICI treatment showed a better survival outcome (p=0.01).
