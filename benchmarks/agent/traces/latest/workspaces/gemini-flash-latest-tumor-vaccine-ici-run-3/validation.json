This study explored a new way to sensitize these non-responsive tumors. Researchers found that injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into the tumor creates a strong local inflammatory signal, specifically a Type I interferon response. This signal acts like an alarm, dramatically increasing the tumor's visibility to the immune system by presenting a much wider range of tumor proteins (up to 62.3% of tumor proteins, up from 37.3%). Critically, this induction also increases the expression of PD-L1, which makes the tumor more vulnerable to ICI drugs like anti-PD-L1. In mouse models, the combination treatment led to better tumor control. Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic cancer patients suggested that those who had received a standard SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine before starting ICI treatment had improved survival (p=0.01). The authors propose that the common mRNA vaccine components can be repurposed to \\\"prime\\\" tumors, making a cold tumor hot and enhancing the effectiveness of existing immunotherapies.
