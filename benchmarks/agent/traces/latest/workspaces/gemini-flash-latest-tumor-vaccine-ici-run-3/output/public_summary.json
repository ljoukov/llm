  "plain_language_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a powerful cancer treatment, but they often fail against \"cold\" tumors that lack immune recognition. This study explored a new way to sensitize these non-responsive tumors. Researchers found that injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into the tumor creates a strong local inflammatory signal, specifically a Type I interferon response. This signal acts like an alarm, dramatically increasing the tumor's visibility to the immune system by presenting a much wider range of tumor proteins (up to 62.3% of tumor proteins, up from 37.3%). Critically, this induction also increases the expression of PD-L1, which makes the tumor more vulnerable to ICI drugs like anti-PD-L1. In mouse models, the combination treatment led to better tumor control. Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic cancer patients suggested that those who had received a standard SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine before starting ICI treatment had improved survival (p=0.01). The authors propose that the common mRNA vaccine components can be repurposed to \"prime\" tumors, making a cold tumor hot and enhancing the effectiveness of existing immunotherapies. However, the human data is only correlational, and formal prospective trials are needed before this approach can be adopted clinically.",

    "Intratumoral mRNA vaccination triggers a potent Type I interferon response that reprograms the tumor microenvironment.",
    "The Type I interferon signaling dramatically broadens the MHC-I-presented antigen repertoire, a mechanism for 'waking up' the immune response.",
    "A retrospective clinical correlation suggests that routine SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination may correlate with improved survival in ICI-treated metastatic cancer patients."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human survival data is retrospective, non-randomized, and prone to residual confounding factors, preventing a direct causal conclusion.",
    "Heterogeneity in tumor types, treatment history, and vaccination timing in the human cohort limit the generalizability of the findings.",
    "The study only supports a biologically coherent hypothesis, and prospective randomized studies are explicitly required before clinical protocol changes are justified."
