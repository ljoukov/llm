A recent study investigated whether mRNA vaccines, similar to those used for COVID-19, could help. The researchers found that injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors in mice made the tumors more recognizable to the immune system. This 'sensitizing' effect appeared to boost the effectiveness of a common type of immunotherapy called immune checkpoint blockade. The study also looked at data from human cancer patients and found that those who had previously received a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine had better survival rates when treated with immunotherapy. While promising, the human data is from a retrospective study, meaning it was not a controlled experiment, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

        "Claim calibration issue in claim_audit.json: C02 (“render tumors more susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade”) is labeled “strong” but is supported only by PD-L1 upregulation (L32) and increased CD8 density (L33). Those are mechanistic correlates, not direct evidence of improved susceptibility/response by themselves. Direct mouse tumor-control support is at L46, which is not cited for C02. Strength should be lower or evidence expanded to include L46.",

Additionally, an important limitation about model-specific strength of mechanistic readouts (L53) is omitted, and two JSON files are schema-invalid, reducing their re"
