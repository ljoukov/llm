    "plain_language_summary": "Cancer immunotherapy, which helps the body's own immune system fight cancer, doesn't work for all patients. This study investigated a new strategy to make immunotherapy more effective. Researchers injected mRNA vaccines directly into tumors in mice, which triggered an immune response and made the tumors more sensitive to a type of immunotherapy called immune checkpoint blockade. A retrospective study of human patients also suggested that those who had received an mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 and were also being treated with immunotherapy for metastatic cancer had better survival rates. While these findings are promising, the human study was not a controlled clinical trial, so more research is needed to confirm if this is a true cause-and-effect relationship and a safe and effective treatment strategy for people with cancer.",

        "The main findings are from mouse studies, which may not translate directly to humans.",

        "The timing and type of mRNA vaccine might be important factors that need more investigation.",
