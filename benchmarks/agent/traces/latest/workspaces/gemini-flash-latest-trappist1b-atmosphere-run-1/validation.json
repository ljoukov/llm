This planet is extremely close to its star and was thought to be airless. The new data, obtained using the MIRI instrument's low-resolution spectrometer, shows two key pieces of evidence for an atmosphere. First, the distribution of heat across the planet's surface is not consistent with a bare rock, but suggests that an atmosphere is moving heat from the scorching dayside to the nightside (heat transport efficiency of 0.19). Second, the emitted light spectrum shows a slight dip near 15 \\u00b5m, which is a tell-tale signature of an atmospheric gas, specifically carbon dioxide. While the dayside temperature is high (342 K), the combination of heat redistribution and spectral absorption strongly favors models with an atmosphere over a strictly airless body. The most plausible atmospheric models suggest a moderate-pressure atmosphere (0.3-1.0 bar) that is likely rich in CO₂.
