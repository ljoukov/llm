    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets. (L47)",
    "Retrieval assumptions (circulation, opacity priors, cloud treatment) significantly affect the resulting quantitative posteriors. (L48)",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics can introduce bias into the measurement of weak spectral features. (L49)",
    "Constraints derived from the night-side of the planet are considerably weaker compared to the day-side constraints in the current observational dataset. (L50)"
