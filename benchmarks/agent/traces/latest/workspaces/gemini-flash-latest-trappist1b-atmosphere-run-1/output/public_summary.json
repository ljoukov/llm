  "headline": "JWST Phase Curve Reveals Strong Evidence for an Atmosphere on the Rocky Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized rocky exoplanet orbiting a cool M dwarf star, likely tidally locked. A key question is whether such planets can retain an atmosphere under strong stellar radiation. This study used the James Webb Space Telescope's MIRI instrument to observe the planet's thermal phase curve. The results provide strong evidence against a strictly airless interpretation, showing that heat is redistributed from the day side, and the spectrum contains features consistent with an atmosphere, potentially rich in CO2. Atmosphere-bearing models better explain the combined data products than airless models, with a likelihood ratio of 7.4. While the exact composition and pressure are still uncertain, the findings mark a crucial step toward characterizing rocky exoplanet atmospheres.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Meaningful observational evidence against a strictly airless interpretation for TRAPPIST-1 b has been found using JWST data.",
    "A non-zero heat transport efficiency (0.19) is favored, suggesting atmospheric or subsurface mechanisms redistribute heat from the scorching day side.",
    "Spectral features consistent with the 15 um CO2 band provide the first joint evidence for an atmospheric component in the planet's thermal emission."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The dataset is limited to a single planet and does not allow for generalization about the atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets.",
    "O2-rich atmosphere cases are not fully ruled out by the current data, meaning the atmospheric composition remains poorly constrained.",
    "The quantitative results depend heavily on model assumptions about atmospheric circulation, cloud treatments, and opacity priors."
