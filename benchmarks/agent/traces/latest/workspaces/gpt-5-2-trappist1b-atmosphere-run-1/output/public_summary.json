  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a hot, Earth-sized rocky planet that likely always shows the same face to its star. A central question is whether such a strongly irradiated world can keep any atmosphere, or whether it has been stripped down to bare rock. In this study, researchers used JWST’s MIRI instrument to observe the planet’s infrared light over an entire orbit (a phase curve). They compared models with no atmosphere to models that include an atmosphere and heat transport from day to night. The results favor some non-zero heat redistribution and show spectral structure near the 15 micrometer carbon-dioxide band, both of which are consistent with an atmosphere. However, the exact atmospheric composition and pressure are still uncertain, and the authors emphasize that follow-up observations are needed.",

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "It is a single-planet study and does not show how common atmospheres are on similar worlds.",
    "Model retrieval results depend on assumptions about circulation, opacities, and clouds/hazes.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics can bias weak spectral features.",
    "Night-side emission is less well constrained than day-side emission in this dataset."
