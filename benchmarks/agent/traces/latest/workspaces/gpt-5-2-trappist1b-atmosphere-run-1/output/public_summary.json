  "headline": "JWST phase-curve data suggest TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a rocky, Earth-sized planet that orbits its small star so closely that it is likely tidally locked, with a permanent day side and night side. The study analyzed JWST MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy taken across the planet’s orbital phase curve, which tracks how the planet’s infrared emission changes as different hemispheres rotate into view. In the reported fits, the planet’s dayside brightness temperature is 342 +/- 22 K and the inferred heat-transport efficiency (epsilon) is 0.19 (+0.23 / -0.14), which favors some day-to-night energy redistribution rather than the perfect airless limit. The energy-balance fits also imply a low Bond albedo (<0.08), meaning the planet appears very dark. In addition, the spectrum shows structure around the 15 um CO2 band (estimated band depth 96 ppm). When the phase-curve and spectral information are fit together, atmosphere-bearing models are preferred over a no-atmosphere model (reported likelihood ratio 7.4). However, the authors emphasize that atmospheric composition and pressure are still uncertain, O2-rich scenarios are not fully ruled out, and follow-up spectroscopy is needed.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "JWST MIRI phase-curve spectroscopy is used to jointly constrain heat transport and atmospheric composition for TRAPPIST-1 b.",
    "The analysis reports non-zero heat redistribution (epsilon) and spectral structure near the 15 um CO2 band consistent with absorption.",
    "A joint comparison of observables favors atmosphere-bearing models over a strictly airless model in combined fits."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The study involves a single planet and cannot determine how common atmospheres are on similar rocky planets.",
    "Retrieval results depend on assumptions about circulation, opacity priors, and clouds/hazes, which can shift posteriors.",
    "Weak spectral features can be affected by stellar variability, instrument systematics, and limited night-side constraints."
