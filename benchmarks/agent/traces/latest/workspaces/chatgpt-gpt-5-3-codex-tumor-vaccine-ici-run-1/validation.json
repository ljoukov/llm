In mice, the vaccine increased inflammatory type I interferon signals, broadened the set of tumor peptides shown on MHC-I, raised PD-L1 expression, and increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration. These changes fit a biological model in which tumors become easier for immune cells to recognize, and therefore more responsive to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The paper also reported a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, where previously vaccinated patients had better survival (p=0.01).
