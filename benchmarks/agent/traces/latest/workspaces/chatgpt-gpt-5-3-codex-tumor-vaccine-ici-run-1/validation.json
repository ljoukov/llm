This study asked whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor could trigger a type I interferon-driven inflammatory state that makes anti-PD-L1 therapy work better. In mouse tumor models, vaccination was linked to broader presentation of tumor-derived peptides (for example, 62.3% vs 37.3% of tumor proteins represented in the immunopeptidome) and a higher type I interferon response score (3.1 vs 1.0). The report also notes increased PD-L1 expression (2.4x vs 1.0x) and increased intratumoral CD8+ T-cell density (1.8x vs 1.0x), which together support combining vaccination with checkpoint blockade. In a retrospective cohort of 130 metastatic patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors, prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was associated with improved survival (reported p=0.01).
