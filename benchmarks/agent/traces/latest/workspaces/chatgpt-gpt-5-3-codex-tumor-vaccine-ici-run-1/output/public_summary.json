  "headline": "mRNA vaccination inside tumors may make checkpoint therapy work better, but proof in trials is still needed",
  "plain_language_summary": "This study tested whether putting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors can help immune checkpoint drugs work in cancers that are otherwise hard to treat. In mouse experiments, the vaccine plus anti-PD-L1 therapy outperformed single-treatment controls and was linked to stronger immune activation inside tumors. The authors report more tumor peptides displayed to immune cells, higher type I interferon signaling, increased PD-L1 expression, and greater CD8+ T-cell infiltration. In a separate retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, people with prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination had better survival statistics (p=0.01). Together, these findings support a plausible biological mechanism and a clinically relevant hypothesis. However, the human data are observational, not randomized, and include variable timing and mixed tumor histories, so the work supports promise rather than clinical proof.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The paper links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to broader antigen presentation and expanded MHC-I peptidomes in tumors.",
    "It connects interferon pathway activation to checkpoint sensitization using perturbation controls such as IFNAR1 blockade.",
    "It bridges mouse mechanism data with a human retrospective ICI cohort stratified by prior mRNA vaccination status."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human cohort is retrospective and non-randomized, leaving substantial risk of residual confounding.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to checkpoint treatment varied, which can bias apparent outcome differences.",
    "Tumor-type and treatment-history heterogeneity limit clean causal interpretation across all patients.",
    "Effects seen in selected mouse models may not generalize to every human cancer context."
