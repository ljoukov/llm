  "headline": "mRNA vaccination inside tumors may help some cancers respond better to checkpoint immunotherapy",
  "plain_language_summary": "This study tested whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors can make resistant cancers more visible to the immune system before giving checkpoint blockade treatment. In mouse models, the combination of intratumoral mRNA vaccine plus anti-PD-L1 was linked to stronger immune-related changes, including higher interferon signaling, broader antigen display on MHC-I, increased PD-L1 expression, and more CD8+ T-cell infiltration. The paper also reports a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, where previously vaccinated patients had better survival (p=0.01). Together, these findings support a plausible biological strategy for improving immunotherapy response, but they do not yet prove causation in patients.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The work links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to broader tumor peptide presentation, including expansion of the MHC-I peptidome.",
    "Mechanistic tests suggest type I interferon signaling is required, because anti-IFNAR1 blockade removed the sensitization effect.",
    "The study combines preclinical mechanism data with a human retrospective survival signal in ICI-treated metastatic patients."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The patient analysis was retrospective and non-randomized, so hidden differences between groups could explain part of the outcome gap.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to checkpoint therapy varied across patients, making treatment effects harder to isolate cleanly.",
    "Tumor-type and prior-treatment heterogeneity limit direct causal interpretation and can reduce generalizability.",
    "Not all mechanistic signals were equally strong across every tested model system."
