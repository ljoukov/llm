  "headline": "mRNA tumor priming may help checkpoint therapy, but human evidence is still observational",
  "plain_language_summary": "This study tested whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors could make immune checkpoint drugs work better. In mouse models, the combination of intratumoral mRNA vaccination plus anti-PD-L1 showed stronger immune activation, including higher interferon signaling, broader antigen display, and more CD8+ T-cell presence. The paper also reports a retrospective analysis of metastatic patients on checkpoint inhibitors, where previously vaccinated patients had better survival statistics (p=0.01). However, the human data do not prove cause and effect because the comparison was non-randomized and clinically heterogeneous. Important control findings temper the conclusion: vaccine-only treatment did not give durable control in non-immunogenic models, ICI-only activity was limited in low-immunogenic settings, lipid particles without mRNA did not reproduce sensitization, and blocking IFNAR1 removed the sensitization benefit.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The study links intratumoral mRNA delivery to a broader tumor immunopeptidome and expanded MHC-I peptide presentation.",
    "It proposes a stepwise mechanism connecting type I interferon induction to improved checkpoint-blockade susceptibility.",
    "It combines preclinical combination-therapy data with a real-world retrospective metastatic ICI cohort stratified by vaccination status."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human cohort was retrospective and non-randomized, so confounding factors may explain part of the survival difference.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI start varied, and mixed tumor types plus prior-treatment heterogeneity limit causal interpretation.",
    "Control results show boundary conditions: vaccine-only and ICI-only arms were insufficient in some settings, so benefit is context dependent.",
    "Mouse-model mechanistic and efficacy signals may not transfer uniformly to all human cancers."
