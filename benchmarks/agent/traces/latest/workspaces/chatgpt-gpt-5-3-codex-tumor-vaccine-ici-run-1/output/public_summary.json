  "plain_language_summary": "This study tested whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors can make immune checkpoint drugs work better. In mouse models, the combination of intratumoral mRNA vaccination plus anti-PD-L1 showed stronger tumor control than either approach alone in low-immunogenic settings. The reported biology suggests the vaccine increased type I interferon signaling, broadened the tumor peptide display on MHC-I, raised PD-L1 expression, and increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration, all of which could make tumors more visible and targetable by the immune system. The authors also examined a retrospective group of 130 metastatic patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors and found better survival in previously vaccinated patients (p=0.01). However, because the human analysis was not randomized, it cannot prove that vaccination caused the survival difference.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The paper links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to broader tumor antigen display in immunopeptidomic readouts.",
    "It proposes a mechanistic chain from local innate sensing and type I interferon signaling to improved checkpoint sensitivity.",
    "It combines preclinical efficacy findings with a human retrospective survival association in ICI-treated metastatic patients."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human cohort analysis was retrospective and non-randomized, so confounding factors may explain part of the survival difference.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to checkpoint inhibitor start varied across patients, complicating interpretation.",
    "Tumor types and prior treatment histories were heterogeneous, which limits direct causal conclusions.",
    "Mouse model results may not translate equally to every human cancer context."
