  "headline": "mRNA vaccination inside tumors may help checkpoint drugs work better, but proof in trials is still needed",
  "plain_language_summary": "This study asked whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors can make immune checkpoint therapy more effective. In mice, the vaccine increased inflammatory type I interferon signals, broadened the set of tumor peptides shown on MHC-I, raised PD-L1 expression, and increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration. These changes fit a biological model in which tumors become easier for immune cells to recognize, and therefore more responsive to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The paper also reported a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, where previously vaccinated patients had better survival (p=0.01). However, that human comparison was not randomized and may be affected by confounding differences between groups. Overall, the findings are promising and mechanistically coherent, but they should be treated as hypothesis-supporting rather than definitive clinical proof until prospective randomized trials are completed.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The study links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to broader tumor antigen presentation in immunopeptidomics readouts.",
    "It proposes a stepwise mechanism from innate sensing to interferon signaling to improved checkpoint targetability.",
    "It combines preclinical efficacy and mechanistic data with a human retrospective signal under ICI treatment."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human evidence comes from a retrospective, non-randomized cohort and is vulnerable to residual confounding.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI start varied across patients, which can bias outcome comparisons.",
    "Tumor-type and prior-treatment heterogeneity make direct causal conclusions difficult.",
    "Mouse model findings may not transfer uniformly to all human cancers."
