This study asks whether putting an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor can trigger a strong local innate immune reaction—especially type I interferon signaling—that makes the tumor more visible to immune cells and more susceptible to anti-PD-L1 therapy. In mouse tumor models, the authors report that intratumoral mRNA vaccination broadens the set of tumor-derived peptides presented on MHC-I and increases signs of immune activation. In a separate retrospective analysis of metastatic patients treated with ICIs, outcomes differed when patients were grouped by prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status during ICI treatment (reported p=0.01).

This violates the requirement that line references are valid and map to the numbered report lines.",

However, the claim audit contains at least one incorrect line reference (C04 uses L55 for text that is actually at L56), which fails the requirement that citations map correctly to the numbered report lines and undermines auditability."
