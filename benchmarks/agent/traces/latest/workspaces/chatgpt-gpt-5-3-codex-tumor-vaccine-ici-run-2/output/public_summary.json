  "headline": "mRNA vaccination inside tumors may boost response to checkpoint immunotherapy",
  "plain_language_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can lead to long-lasting tumor control in some people, but many tumors do not respond because they are not well recognized by the immune system. This study asks whether putting an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor can trigger a strong local innate immune reaction—especially type I interferon signaling—that makes the tumor more visible to immune cells and more susceptible to anti-PD-L1 therapy. In mouse tumor models, the authors report that intratumoral mRNA vaccination broadens the set of tumor-derived peptides presented on MHC-I and increases signs of immune activation. In a separate retrospective analysis of metastatic patients treated with ICIs, outcomes differed when patients were grouped by prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status during ICI treatment (reported p=0.01). Because the human data are retrospective and non-randomized, the work supports a mechanistic hypothesis but does not yet justify changes to clinical practice without prospective randomized trials.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to broader antigen presentation in tumors (immunopeptidome and MHC-I peptidome).",
    "Proposes a mechanistic chain from type I interferon signaling to increased tumor visibility and PD-L1 pathway activity.",
    "Adds a retrospective human cohort comparison stratified by prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status during ICI treatment."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, so confounding could explain some or all of the survival difference.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied, complicating interpretation of cause and effect.",
    "Mouse model results may not translate directly to all human tumor types and treatment histories.",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems rather than uniformly across settings."
