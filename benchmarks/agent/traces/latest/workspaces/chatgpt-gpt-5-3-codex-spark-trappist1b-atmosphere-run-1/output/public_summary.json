  "headline": "JWST phase-curve data strongly favor but do not fully pin down an atmosphere for TRAPPIST-1 b.",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a very hot, close-in rocky planet. JWST's MIRI instrument measured how the planet's infrared heat signal changes over its orbit, producing a thermal phase curve and a spectrum. The team reports a dayside temperature near 342 +/- 22 K, non-zero heat redistribution (epsilon around 0.19), a very low Bond albedo (<0.08), and a 15 µm CO2-like feature of about 96 ppm. A combined likelihood ratio of 7.4 versus a no-atmosphere baseline indicates the atmospheric interpretation fits the joint data better than an airless model. At the same time, the exact atmospheric pressure and makeup remain uncertain, with O2-rich cases not fully excluded and possible degeneracies in models, clouds, and circulation still affecting conclusions.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The paper combines phase-curve heat-transport information with spectral band structure in one joint retrieval framework.",
    "It reports a non-zero heat transport parameter and CO2-band structure together, which together favor atmospheric interpretations.",
    "It narrows toward a moderate-pressure CO2-rich option (0.3-1.0 bar) while explicitly keeping alternative compositions possible."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "Interpretations depend on model assumptions such as circulation, opacity priors, and cloud or haze treatment.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics may bias weak spectral features in this dataset.",
    "Night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints, limiting the certainty of whole-planet conclusions.",
    "The work covers one planet, so broader atmospheric conclusions for M-dwarf rocky planets remain uncertain."
