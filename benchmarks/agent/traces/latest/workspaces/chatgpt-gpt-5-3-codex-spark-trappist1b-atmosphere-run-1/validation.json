The report’s framing is more cautious (“meaningful evidence against a strictly airless interpretation… composition and pressure remain uncertain… follow-up essential”, L53) and highlights substantial degeneracies and systematics (L37–L50).",
        "Wording overreach: claim_audit.json C05 says “A detected 15 μm feature…”, whereas the report describes a “15 um CO2 spectral band depth estimate” and that the structure is “consistent with atmospheric absorption” (L30), with explicit caveats about weak-feature bias from stellar variability and instrument systematics (L49). “Detected” implies higher confidence than “consistent with.”"
