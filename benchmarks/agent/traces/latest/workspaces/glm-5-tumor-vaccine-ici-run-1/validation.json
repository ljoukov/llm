The report does assert improved tumor control (L46), but that line is part of the proposed mechanistic chain rather than a dedicated efficacy metric in the Quantitative Findings table (L25–L34). This is acceptable but should ideally be supported by explicit tumor-growth/response numbers if available.",
        "The public_summary phrase \"Type I interferon responses increased 3-fold\" is a rounded restatement of 3.1 vs 1.0 (L31). It is directionally correct and not misleading, but it is slightly less precise than the report’s stated normalized units."

Claims are generally calibrated, especially for the human survival association (moderate strength with confounding caveat). The main minor weakness is that the\n"
