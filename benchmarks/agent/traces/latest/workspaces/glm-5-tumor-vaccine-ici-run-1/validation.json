The researchers found that injecting an mRNA vaccine into tumors triggered a strong immune response, making cancer cells more visible to the immune system. In mice, combining the vaccine with checkpoint inhibitors led to better tumor control. The researchers also looked at human patients who had received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines before cancer treatment. Those who were vaccinated seemed to respond better to checkpoint inhibitors.

        "The claim_audit.json output is explicitly marked groundingValid=false, and multiple “quotes” are not found verbatim in the report (as noted in the validationErrors). This violates the requirement that line references be valid/mappable and undermines downstream auditability.",
        "claim_audit.json uses fabricated/reconstructed quote strings (for L28–L32 and L30) rather than quoting the report text. Even though the numbers align with the table, the output presents them as verbatim quotes, which is unfaithful to the provided report lines.",
        "Several claim strength labels in claim_audit.json appear overconfident given the report caveats (L53: mechanistic readouts strongest in specific model systems; L49–L52: translation limits). Marking multiple mechanistic claims as “strong” is not well-calibrated to the stated threats to validity.",

However, the bundle fails overall because claim_audit.json contains non-verbatim ‘quotes’ that cannot be located in the numbered report lines (groundingValid=false), which breaks strict traceability requirements and introduces overconfident claim-strength calibration relative to L"
