  "headline": "mRNA vaccines may help immunotherapy work better against tumors",
  "plain_language_summary": "Scientists found that injecting an mRNA vaccine into tumors can improve cancer immunotherapy. In mice, this combination triggered stronger immune responses and better tumor control. The vaccine activates interferon signaling, which helps the immune system recognize cancer cells. Patient records suggest prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination may improve immunotherapy response. These findings require confirmation through clinical trials before changing practice.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Intratumoral mRNA vaccination can prime tumors to be more visible to the immune system by expanding the range of proteins displayed on cell surfaces.",
    "The combination of mRNA vaccination and anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade works through type I interferon signaling to improve tumor control.",
    "Retrospective human data suggests prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination may improve outcomes for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human study looked back at existing medical records rather than tracking patients prospectively, so other factors could explain the apparent benefit.",
    "The timing between vaccination and cancer treatment varied widely among patients, making it hard to know the best approach.",
    "Different tumor types and prior treatments were mixed together, limiting how broadly the findings can be applied.",
    "Results from mouse models do not always translate directly to human cancers."
