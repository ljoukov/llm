  "headline": "mRNA vaccines may help immune therapies fight tumors more effectively",
  "plain_language_summary": "Researchers found that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors can make cancers more visible to the immune system. The vaccine triggers a natural alarm signal called type I interferon, which helps immune cells recognize tumor proteins. In mouse studies, combining this vaccine with an existing cancer treatment called immune checkpoint blockade led to better tumor control. The researchers also looked at cancer patients who had received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines before their cancer treatment. Patients who were vaccinated showed better survival rates when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to unvaccinated patients. However, this human finding comes from looking back at existing records rather than a controlled experiment, so other factors could explain the difference. More rigorous studies are needed before changing how doctors treat cancer patients.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Demonstrates that intratumoral mRNA vaccination expands the range of tumor proteins visible to T cells by over 25 percentage points.",
    "Shows that type I interferon signaling is required for the vaccine sensitization effect through blocking experiments.",
    "Provides retrospective human evidence suggesting prior mRNA vaccination may improve response to immune checkpoint inhibitors."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, meaning other differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients could explain the survival benefit.",
    "Vaccination timing varied across patients, so the optimal timing for vaccination before cancer treatment remains unknown.",
    "Mouse model results may not fully translate to human cancers due to biological differences between species.",
    "The study looked at mixed tumor types and treatment histories, making it hard to know which patients might benefit most."
