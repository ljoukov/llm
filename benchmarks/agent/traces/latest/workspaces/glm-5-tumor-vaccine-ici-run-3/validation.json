L33 is an immune infiltration readout, not a tumor-control endpoint. The report’s explicit tumor-control statement is at L46; using L33 as primary support risks conflating mechanism with efficacy.",

However, the public summary introduces a quantitatively incorrect statement (\"over 25 percentage points\" vs exactly 25.0 pp from L28), and the claim audit partially mis-grounds efficacy by citing an immunologic surrogate (L33) as evidence of tumor control rather than relying on the explicit efficacy statement (L46).
