These cancer drugs work by releasing the brakes on the immune system, allowing it to attack tumors. However, many tumors do not respond well to these treatments. The scientists found that injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors triggered an inflammatory response that made cancer cells more visible to the immune system. In mouse studies, this combination therapy led to better tumor control. In a retrospective analysis of 130 human patients, those who had received an mRNA vaccine before cancer treatment showed improved survival.
