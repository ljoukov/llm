  "headline": "mRNA shots inside tumors may boost checkpoint therapy, but human proof is still preliminary",
  "plain_language_summary": "This study asks whether local delivery of an mRNA vaccine into tumors can make cancers more responsive to immune checkpoint therapy. In mice, the authors report broader antigen presentation, stronger interferon signaling, and greater immune-cell infiltration with the combination strategy, including higher MHC-I peptide coverage and increased PD-L1 signaling. In the human retrospective cohort, vaccinated patients showed a lower survival p-value (p=0.01) than unvaccinated patients during ICI treatment, suggesting a potential association rather than proof. Important controls indicate that the benefit is not reproduced by non-mRNA particles and is lost when type I interferon signaling is blocked. Overall, this supports a biologically plausible mechanism while highlighting the need for prospective randomized validation before changing care."

  "what_is_new": [
    "The work links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to a marked increase in reported tumor immunopeptidome coverage, implying wider antigen display to immune cells.",
    "Type I interferon signaling is proposed as a required driver of sensitization, with mechanistic blocks showing loss of effect when IFNAR1 is inhibited.",
    "The translational signal combines pooled mouse efficacy data with a human retrospective signal (vaccinated subgroup, p=0.01) rather than a randomized clinical endpoint."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human part is retrospective and non-randomized, so confounding and selection bias could influence observed differences.",
    "Vaccination timing around ICI initiation was not standardized, making temporal confounding possible.",
    "Patient tumor mix and prior treatment history were heterogeneous, limiting a direct causal interpretation for all cancer subtypes.",
    "Preclinical models may not fully predict clinical benefit in humans, so translation remains uncertain."
