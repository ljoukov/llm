The report states a survival comparison p-value of 0.01 with improved survival association in the vaccinated subgroup (L30), not a separate p-value per group."

No new quantitative claims were introduced beyond those in the report. The outputs include the key limitations of the retrospective human analysis (L49–L53) and appropriately treat the human finding as associative/observational. Overall, the JSON is coherent and suitable/"
