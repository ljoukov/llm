  "major_limitations": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized; residual confounding is likely",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients",
    "Tumor-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity limit direct causal interpretation",
    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumors",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems rather than uniformly across all tested settings"
