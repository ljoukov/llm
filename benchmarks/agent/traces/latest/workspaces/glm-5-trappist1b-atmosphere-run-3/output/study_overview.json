    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets.",
    "Retrieval assumptions (circulation, opacity priors, cloud treatment) affect quantitative posteriors.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics can bias weak spectral features.",
    "Night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints in the current dataset.",
    "Degeneracies between composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation assumptions remain significant."
