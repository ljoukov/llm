  "headline": "JWST finds evidence that TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized rocky planet orbiting very close to its star, likely with one side permanently facing the star and one side in permanent darkness. Scientists used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to observe the planet's heat patterns as it orbits, looking for signs of an atmosphere. They measured how heat moves from the planet's day side to its night side and found evidence of heat redistribution, which suggests the presence of an atmosphere. They also detected a subtle spectral signature around 15 micrometers consistent with carbon dioxide absorption. Together, these observations favor models where the planet has an atmosphere over models where it is a bare rock. However, the exact composition and pressure of any atmosphere remain uncertain, and follow-up observations will be essential to confirm these findings and better characterize the planet's atmospheric properties.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "First JWST phase-curve spectroscopy of TRAPPIST-1 b revealing both thermal and spectral constraints simultaneously.",
    "Quantitative measurement of non-zero heat transport efficiency (epsilon = 0.19) inconsistent with bare-rock expectations.",
    "Detection of 96 ppm spectral structure at 15 micrometers consistent with CO2 atmospheric absorption."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This is a single-planet study and cannot establish whether atmospheres are common around M-dwarf rocky planets.",
    "Retrieval models depend on assumptions about atmospheric circulation, cloud properties, and opacity that affect results.",
    "Weak spectral features could be influenced by stellar variability or instrument systematics rather than true atmospheric signals.",
    "Night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints, limiting the precision of heat transport measurements.",
    "Multiple atmospheric compositions (including O2-rich scenarios) remain compatible with current observations."
