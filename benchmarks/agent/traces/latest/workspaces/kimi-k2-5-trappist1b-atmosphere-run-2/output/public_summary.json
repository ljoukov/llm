  "headline": "JWST finds evidence that TRAPPIST-1 b likely has an atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a rocky planet about the size of Earth orbiting very close to its small, cool star. Because it is so close, scientists wondered if it still has any atmosphere left or if stellar radiation has stripped it bare. Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, researchers measured how the planet's brightness changes as it orbits its star (called a phase curve) and analyzed its infrared light spectrum. They found that the planet shows signs of heat being transported from its day side to its night side, and they detected subtle spectral features consistent with carbon dioxide absorption. These observations favor models that include an atmosphere over models of a bare rock. However, the exact composition, pressure, and extent of the atmosphere remain uncertain and will require additional observations to pin down.",

    "First phase-curve study of TRAPPIST-1 b using JWST MIRI spectroscopy, combining thermal phase variations with spectral analysis",
    "Evidence for non-zero heat redistribution efficiency (epsilon ~ 0.19) suggesting atmospheric heat transport rather than bare-rock reradiation",
    "Detection of spectral structure near 15 microns consistent with CO2 absorption, providing compositional constraints"
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This is a single-planet study that cannot be generalized to all rocky planets around M dwarf stars",
    "Retrieval models depend on assumptions about atmospheric circulation, cloud properties, and opacity that affect the quantitative results",
    "Weak spectral features can be affected by stellar variability and instrument systematics, and night-side constraints are weaker than day-side"
