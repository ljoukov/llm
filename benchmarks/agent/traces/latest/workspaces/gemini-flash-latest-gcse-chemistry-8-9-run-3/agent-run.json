This gives 4.20 g of CaCO3. Next, the moles of CaCO3 are found using n = m / Mr with Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1. n(CaCO3) = 4.20 g / 100.1 ≈ 0.04196 mol. From the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the mole ratio is 1:1, so n(CO2) = n(CaCO3). Finally, the maximum mass of CO2 is calculated: m(CO2) = n(CO2) * Mr(CO2), using Mr(CO2) = 44.0. m(CO2) = 0.04196 mol * 44.0 g mol-1 ≈ 1.85 g.\",\n  \"key_equations\": [\n    \"n = m / Mr\",\n    \"CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O\"\n  ],\n  \"line_refs\": [\n    \"L14\",\n    \"L26\",\n    \"L33\",\n    \"L34\"\n  ],\n  \"checks\": [\n    \"The calculated mass of CO2 (44.0) is less than the mass of CaCO3 (100.1) that produced it, which is physically sensible.\",\n    \"The ratio of mass CO2 to mass CaCO3 is 44.0 / 100.1 ≈ 0.4396, so 4.20 g of CaCO3 should yield 4.20 * 0.4396 ≈ 1.846 g of CO2. This confirms the answer.\"\n  ]\n}"
