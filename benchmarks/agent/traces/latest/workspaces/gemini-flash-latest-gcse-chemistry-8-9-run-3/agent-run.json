The precision note is in there too, flagging three significant figures.\n\n\n**Constructing the Method Section**\n\nI'm now detailing the method section. I've broken down the calculation into clear steps. I have a moles calculation for NaOH, followed by a mole ratio application for H2SO4, and then the final concentration calculation. I've also added the line references for added clarity.\n\n\n**Analyzing Bond Energies Now**\n\nThe structure is set for the calculation, and I'm tackling problem P04. I've broken down the bonds to be broken and formed, calculating the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (CH4 and O2). The sum of these, 2648 kJ/mol, is complete. I'm now proceeding with the bond-forming side.\n\n\n**Reviewing the JSON Structure**\n\nI'm now implementing the problem P04 JSON. The `problem_id` is \"P04\".

I've used the current and time to find the total charge, then used Faraday's constant to get moles of electrons, and the half-equation's stoichiometry to calculate the moles of copper. Finally, I'm multiplying the moles of copper by its molar mass to determine the mass deposited.
