  "method": "The enthalpy change (\u0394H) is calculated using the formula \u0394H = \u2211(bonds broken) - \u2211(bonds formed). \n1. Energy required to break bonds (Reactants: CH4 + 2O2): $E_{\\text{broken}} = [4 \\times (C-H)] + [2 \\times (O=O)] = [4 \\times 413] + [2 \\times 498] = 1652 + 996 = 2648 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n2. Energy released when forming bonds (Products: CO2 + 2H2O): $E_{\\text{formed}} = [2 \\times (C=O)] + [4 \\times (O-H)] = [2 \\times 805] + [4 \\times 463] = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n3. Calculate \u0394H: $\\Delta H = 2648 - 3462 = -814 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$.",
