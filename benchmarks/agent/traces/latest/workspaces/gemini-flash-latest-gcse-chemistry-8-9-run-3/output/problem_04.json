  "method": "The enthalpy change (ΔH) is estimated using the formula ΔH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). The bonds broken are 4 C-H bonds (4 * 413 = 1652 kJ mol-1) and 2 O=O bonds (2 * 498 = 996 kJ mol-1), summing to 2648 kJ mol-1. The bonds formed are 2 C=O bonds (2 * 805 = 1610 kJ mol-1) and 4 O-H bonds (4 * 463 = 1852 kJ mol-1), summing to 3462 kJ mol-1. ΔH = 2648 kJ mol-1 - 3462 kJ mol-1 = -814 kJ mol-1.",

    "Since the reaction is combustion, it should be highly exothermic, meaning a large negative ΔH. The calculated value of -814 kJ mol-1 is a large negative value.",
    "The total energy of bonds formed (3462 kJ mol-1) is greater than the total energy of bonds broken (2648 kJ mol-1), indicating an exothermic process."
