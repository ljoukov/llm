  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentration of each species using c = n / V, with the volume V = 2.00 dm3. [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Second, substitute these concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.008100 / 0.110 ≈ 0.0736.",

  "checks": [
    "Kc < 1 suggests that the equilibrium lies to the left, favoring the reactants (N2O4) over the products (NO2). This is consistent with n(N2O4) > n(NO2) at equilibrium.",
    "The calculated value is reported as dimensionless as specified in the report."
