  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the species using the volume $V = 2.00 \\text{ dm}^3$ and the formula $c = n/V$. [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm\u00b3 = 0.0900 mol dm\u207b\u00b3. [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm\u00b3 = 0.110 mol dm\u207b\u00b3. Next, substitute these concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression: $K_c = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]$. $K_c = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 \\approx 0.073636$. The result is rounded to 3 significant figures: $0.0736$. The units are omitted as per the problem instructions.",
