  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the sample by applying the purity percentage: mass(CaCO3) = 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, calculate the moles of CaCO3 using the formula n = m / Mr: n(CaCO3) = 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 \u2248 0.041958 mol. From the balanced equation (CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O), the mole ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced is also \u2248 0.041958 mol. Finally, calculate the maximum mass of CO2 using m = n * Mr, with Mr(CO2) = 44.0: mass(CO2) = 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g mol-1 \u2248 1.846 g. Rounding to 3 significant figures gives 1.85 g.",
