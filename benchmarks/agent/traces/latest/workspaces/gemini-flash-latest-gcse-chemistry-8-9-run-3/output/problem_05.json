  "method": "First, calculate the total charge passed (Q) by converting time to seconds: $t = 30.0 \\text{ min} \\times 60 \\text{ s/min} = 1800 \\text{ s}$. $Q = I \\times t = 1.50 \\text{ A} \\times 1800 \\text{ s} = 2700 \\text{ C}$. Next, calculate the moles of electrons ($n_{e^\\text{-}}$) using the Faraday constant ($F = 96500 \\text{ C mol}^{-1}$): $n_{e^\\text{-}} = Q / F = 2700 \\text{ C} / 96500 \\text{ C mol}^{-1} \\approx 0.027979 \\text{ mol}$. From the half-equation $\\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^\\text{-} \\to \\text{Cu}$, the mole ratio is $2e^\\text{-} : 1\\text{ Cu}$. Moles of $\\text{Cu}$ deposited is $n_{Cu} = n_{e^\\text{-}} / 2 \\approx 0.013989 \\text{ mol}$. Finally, calculate the mass of $\\text{Cu}$ using its atomic mass ($63.55$): $m_{Cu} = n_{Cu} \\times A_r(Cu) \\approx 0.013989 \\text{ mol} \\times 63.55 \\text{ g mol}^{-1} \\approx 0.889 \\text{ g}$ (3 SF).",
