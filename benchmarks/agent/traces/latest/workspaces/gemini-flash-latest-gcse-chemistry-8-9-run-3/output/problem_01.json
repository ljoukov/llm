  "method": "The new concentration (c2) is calculated using the dilution formula, c1V1 = c2V2. The formula is rearranged to c2 = c1 * (V1 / V2), where c1 is the initial concentration, V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume. The initial concentration is 0.200 mol dm-3, the initial volume is 25.0 cm3, and the final volume is 250.0 cm3. c2 = 0.200 mol dm-3 * (25.0 cm3 / 250.0 cm3) = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "Units are consistent: mol dm-3 * (cm3 / cm3) = mol dm-3."
