  },
  "method": "The dilution equation $c_1V_1 = c_2V_2$ is used to find the new concentration $c_2$. Rearranging gives $c_2 = c_1 \\times (V_1 / V_2)$. Substituting the values from the report: $c_2 = 0.200 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3} \\times (25.0 \\text{ cm}^3 / 250.0 \\text{ cm}^3)$. Since the volumes are used as a ratio, unit conversion is not necessary. The calculation is $c_2 = 0.200 \\times 0.100 = 0.0200 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$.",
