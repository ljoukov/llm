  "method": "First, calculate the moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = C(NaOH) \u00d7 V(NaOH) = 0.150 mol dm\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 (23.40 / 1000) dm\u00b3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation (H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O), the mole ratio is 1:2. Therefore, the moles of H2SO4 neutralized is n(H2SO4) = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4: C(H2SO4) = n(H2SO4) / V(H2SO4) = 0.001755 mol / (25.00 / 1000) dm\u00b3 = 0.0702 mol dm\u207b\u00b3.",

    "The mole ratio of 1:2 for H2SO4:NaOH was correctly applied.",
    "Volume conversions from cm\u00b3 to dm\u00b3 were correctly performed for both acid and base volumes.",
    "The final concentration is less than the base concentration, which is chemically plausible as sulfuric acid is diprotic."
