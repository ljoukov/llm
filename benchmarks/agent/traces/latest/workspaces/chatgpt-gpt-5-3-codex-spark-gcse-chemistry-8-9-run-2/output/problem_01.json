  "method": "Use the dilution relationship c1V1 = c2V2. Substitute the given initial data c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3, V1 = 25.0 cm3 and V2 = 250.0 cm3. Convert concentrations directly using the same volume units, so c2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. This is the final HCl concentration after dilution.",
