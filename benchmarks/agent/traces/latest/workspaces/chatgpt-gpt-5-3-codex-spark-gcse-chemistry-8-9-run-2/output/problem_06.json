  "method": "Use the equilibrium expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] with the given equilibrium moles in a 2.00 dm3 vessel. Convert to concentrations: [NO2] = 0.180/2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3, [N2O4] = 0.220/2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Substitute: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0736. Reported as dimensionless per instructions.",

  "checks": [
    "Concentrations are around 0.1 mol dm-3; ratio squared divided by concentration gives value < 1, plausible for this equilibrium direction.",
    "The result is unitless, matching instruction that Kc is dimensionless for this task."
