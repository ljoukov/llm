  "method": "Apply a Hess-style bond-energy estimate: ΔH = Σ(bonds broken) – Σ(bonds formed). For CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O, bonds broken are 4 C–H bonds and 2 O=O bonds: 4×413 + 2×498 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed are in CO2 and 2H2O: 2×C=O and 4×O−H, so 2×805 + 4×463 = 3462 kJ mol-1. Therefore ΔH = 2648 – 3462 = −814 kJ mol-1 (exothermic combustion).",

    "Combustion of methane should be strongly exothermic; negative ΔH sign is chemically reasonable.",
    "If only one wrong bond count were used (e.g., 1 C=O), the sign or magnitude would become much less plausible."
