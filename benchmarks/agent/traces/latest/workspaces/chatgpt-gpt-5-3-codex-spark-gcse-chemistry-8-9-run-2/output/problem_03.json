  "method": "Use moles of NaOH: n(NaOH)=c×V, where c=0.150 mol dm-3 and V=23.40 cm3 =0.02340 dm3. Thus n(NaOH)=0.150×0.02340=0.00351 mol. From  H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, only half the moles of NaOH give moles of H2SO4: n(H2SO4)=n(NaOH)/2=0.001755 mol. Divide by H2SO4 sample volume 25.00 cm3=0.02500 dm3 to get c(H2SO4)=0.001755/0.02500=0.0702 mol dm-3.",

  "checks": [
    "0.150 mol dm-3 NaOH with 23.40 cm3 gives only a few mmol NaOH, so H2SO4 is expected near 0.07 mol dm-3.",
    "Stoometric ratio 2:1 means half moles are acid, halving NaOH moles before final concentration division."
