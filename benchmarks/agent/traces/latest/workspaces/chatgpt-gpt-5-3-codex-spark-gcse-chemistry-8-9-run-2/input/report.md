# GCSE Chemistry Quantitative Challenge (Grade 8-9)

## Provenance
- Scope: GCSE Chemistry Higher Tier style quantitative problem set.
- Benchmark note: This is a synthesized exam-style set aligned with AQA GCSE Chemistry (8462) quantitative topics.
- Specification reference: https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse/chemistry-8462/specification-at-a-glance

## Instructions
- Solve each problem from the given data only.
- Use appropriate significant figures and clear working.
- Use only equations/constants listed in this document.

## Constants and Formula Reminders
- Moles: n = m / Mr
- Concentration: c = n / V (V in dm3)
- Dilution: c1V1 = c2V2
- Charge: Q = I * t
- Moles of electrons: n(e-) = Q / F
- Faraday constant: F = 96,500 C mol-1
- At equilibrium for N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g): Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]
- Report Kc as dimensionless (unitless).

## Atomic / Formula Data
- H = 1.0, C = 12.0, O = 16.0, S = 32.1, Ca = 40.1, Cu = 63.55
- Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1
- Mr(CO2) = 44.0

## Problem P01 (Dilution)
A technician transfers 25.0 cm3 of 0.200 mol dm-3 HCl into a volumetric flask and dilutes it with water to a final volume of 250.0 cm3.
Find the new concentration of HCl in mol dm-3.

## Problem P02 (Stoichiometry + Purity)
Limestone sample mass = 5.00 g. The sample is 84.0% CaCO3 by mass.
Reaction: CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O
Assume acid is in excess.
Calculate the maximum mass of CO2 that can be produced.

## Problem P03 (Titration)
25.00 cm3 of H2SO4 is neutralized by 23.40 cm3 of 0.150 mol dm-3 NaOH.
Reaction: H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O
Calculate the concentration of H2SO4 in mol dm-3.

## Problem P04 (Bond Energy Estimate)
Estimate deltaH for methane combustion using mean bond energies.
Equation: CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O
Bond energies (kJ mol-1): C-H = 413, O=O = 498, C=O (in CO2) = 805, O-H = 463
Use: deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed)

## Problem P05 (Electrolysis)
Copper is deposited during electrolysis of aqueous CuSO4 using inert electrodes.
Current = 1.50 A, time = 30.0 min.
Half-equation at cathode: Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu
Calculate the mass of copper deposited.

## Problem P06 (Equilibrium Constant)
For N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g), at equilibrium in a 2.00 dm3 vessel:
- moles(NO2) = 0.180 mol
- moles(N2O4) = 0.220 mol
Calculate Kc.
