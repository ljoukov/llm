  "headline": "JWST phase‑curve observations provide the first atmospheric evidence for the rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST‑1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "Using JWST’s MIRI instrument, astronomers measured how the infrared light from the Earth‑sized planet TRAPPIST‑1 b changes over its orbit. The data show a modest daytime temperature of about 340 K, a measurable heat‑transport efficiency (ε≈0.2) that cannot be produced by a bare rock, and a weak absorption feature around 15 µm that matches carbon‑dioxide. Together these pieces favour a thin, CO₂‑rich atmosphere with a pressure of a few tenths of a bar, rather than an airless world. However, the conclusions rely on model assumptions about atmospheric circulation, cloud treatment, and instrumental systematics, so further observations are needed to confirm the planet’s atmosphere and its composition.",

    "Detection of non‑zero heat‑transport efficiency on a terrestrial exoplanet, indicating atmospheric circulation.",
    "Identification of a 96 ppm absorption feature in the 15 µm CO₂ band, the first spectroscopic hint of a specific gas on TRAPPIST‑1 b.",
    "Joint likelihood analysis showing the atmospheric model is 7.4 times more probable than a bare‑rock scenario."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The study focuses on a single planet, so the result does not generalise to other M‑dwarf rocky worlds.",
    "Retrieved atmospheric parameters depend on retrieval assumptions such as circulation patterns, cloud opacity, and priors.",
    "Stellar variability and instrumental systematics could mimic or suppress weak spectral signals."
