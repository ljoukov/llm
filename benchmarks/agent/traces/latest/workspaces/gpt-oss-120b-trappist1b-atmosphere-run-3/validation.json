Converting a likelihood ratio into “more probable” can be misleading without clarifying it is a likelihood ratio under specific models, not a posterior odds/probability statement. This is a calibration/usefulness problem for downstream review.",

The report language is more cautious (“better explain,” L31; plus caveats and degeneracies, L37–L50). The strength label should be moderated to avoid overstatement.",
