The researchers tested this approach in mice with various cancers and also analyzed data from cancer patients who had previously received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. They found that injecting mRNA into tumors triggered an immune response that made the tumors more visible to the immune system and increased levels of PD-L1, a protein targeted by existing cancer drugs. When combined with checkpoint inhibitor drugs (anti-PD-L1 therapy), this approach helped control tumor growth in mice. In the human data, patients who had received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines showed better survival rates when treated with cancer immunotherapy compared to unvaccinated patients.
