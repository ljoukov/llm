This study investigated whether mRNA vaccines, similar to those used for COVID-19, could be delivered directly into tumors to make them more sensitive to immunotherapy. In laboratory experiments with mice, injecting mRNA into tumors triggered an immune alarm system (called type I interferon response) that made cancer cells display more signals on their surface, helping immune cells find them. When combined with checkpoint inhibitor drugs, this approach improved tumor control. The researchers also analyzed medical records of cancer patients who had received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines before immunotherapy and found they had better survival outcomes than unvaccinated patients. However, this human data comes from a retrospective analysis, not a randomized trial, so it cannot prove cause-and-effect.
