        "output/claim_audit.json misuses line references for subgroup sizes: it cites L22 to support both vaccinated (43) and unvaccinated (87) counts, but the report places unvaccinated at L23 (and total at L21). This is a concrete line-mapping error.",
        "output/claim_audit.json constructs composite evidence strings (e.g., combining metric name, values, and interpretation in one quoted sentence) that do not exist in the report lines L28–L33, which are table entries rather than those exact sentences. This is effectively fabricated quotation text even if the underlying numbers match.",
        "Calibration concern in claim_audit: several mechanistic claims are labeled \"strong\" (C01–C04). While the mechanistic chain is described (L41–L45), the report itself frames the overall conclusion with important caveats and the need for prospective trials (L48–L56). The strength labeling is arguably overstated relative to the report’s cautious framing, reducing practical reliability for downstream review."

However, claim_audit.json fails the grounding requirement: it uses non-verbatim fabricated quotes, includes at least one incorrect line reference (unvaccinated subgroup), and presents evidence in a form that does not map cleanly to the cited report lines. Because valid line-referenced grounding is an explicit"
