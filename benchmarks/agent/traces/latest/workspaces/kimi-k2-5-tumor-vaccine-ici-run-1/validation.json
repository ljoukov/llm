This study investigated whether mRNA vaccines—similar to COVID-19 vaccines but delivered directly into tumors—could make cold tumors hot by triggering inflammation and interferon signaling. In laboratory mice, injecting mRNA into tumors increased antigen presentation, PD-L1 expression, and CD8+ T-cell infiltration, making the tumors more susceptible to checkpoint blockade therapy. The researchers also analyzed a retrospective cohort of 130 metastatic cancer patients and found that those who had previously received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines showed better survival when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, this human data is observational and not from a randomized trial, so definitive conclusions cannot be drawn.
