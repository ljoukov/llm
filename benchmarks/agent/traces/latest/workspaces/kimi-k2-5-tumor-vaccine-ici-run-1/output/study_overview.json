  "major_limitations": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized; residual confounding is likely.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients.",
    "Tumor-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity limit direct causal interpretation.",
    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumors.",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems rather than uniformly across all tested settings."
