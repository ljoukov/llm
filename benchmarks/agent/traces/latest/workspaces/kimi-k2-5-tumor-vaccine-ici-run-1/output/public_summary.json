  "plain_language_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors are powerful cancer drugs that help the immune system attack tumors, but many cancers do not respond because the immune system cannot see the tumor cells. This study investigated whether mRNA vaccines—similar to COVID-19 vaccines but delivered directly into tumors—could make cold tumors hot by triggering inflammation and interferon signaling. In laboratory mice, injecting mRNA into tumors increased antigen presentation, PD-L1 expression, and CD8+ T-cell infiltration, making the tumors more susceptible to checkpoint blockade therapy. The researchers also analyzed a retrospective cohort of 130 metastatic cancer patients and found that those who had previously received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines showed better survival when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, this human data is observational and not from a randomized trial, so definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. The study establishes a biologically coherent rationale for combining intratumoral mRNA vaccination with checkpoint inhibitors, but prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm safety and efficacy in humans.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Intratumoral delivery of mRNA vaccines can create an interferon-rich inflammatory microenvironment that sensitizes previously non-responsive tumors to checkpoint blockade",
    "Prior systemic mRNA vaccination for COVID-19 may confer an unexpected survival advantage in metastatic cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy",
    "Mechanistic studies show that mRNA vaccination substantially expands the repertoire of tumor peptides displayed on MHC-I molecules, potentially improving immune visibility"
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, meaning hidden factors (confounding) could explain the observed differences rather than vaccination itself",
    "Vaccination timing relative to cancer treatment initiation varied across patients, and tumor types were mixed, limiting confident causal interpretation",
    "Mouse model results, while mechanistically informative, do not always directly translate to human cancer biology and treatment responses",
    "Some of the strongest mechanistic effects were only seen in specific model systems, not uniformly across all tested settings"
