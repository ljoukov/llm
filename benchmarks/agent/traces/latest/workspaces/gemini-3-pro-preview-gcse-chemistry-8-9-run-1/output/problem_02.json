  "method": "First, calculate the mass of CaCO3 in the sample by multiplying the total mass (5.00 g) by the purity (84.0%). Mass(CaCO3) = 5.00 * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, determine the moles of CaCO3 using the formula n = m / Mr. With Mr(CaCO3) given as 100.1, n(CaCO3) = 4.20 / 100.1 = 0.041958... mol. The balanced equation shows a 1:1 molar ratio between CaCO3 and CO2. Thus, moles of CO2 = 0.041958... mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 using n * Mr(CO2), where Mr(CO2) is 44.0. Mass(CO2) = 0.041958... * 44.0 = 1.846... g. Rounding to 3 significant figures gives 1.85 g.",
