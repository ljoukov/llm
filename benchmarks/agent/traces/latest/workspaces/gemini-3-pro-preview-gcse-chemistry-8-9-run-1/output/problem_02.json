  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample by multiplying the total mass by the percentage purity: 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, determine the number of moles of CaCO3 using the molar mass Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1: moles = 4.20 / 100.1 = 0.041958 mol. According to the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced is also 0.041958 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 using its molar mass Mr(CO2) = 44.0: mass = 0.041958 * 44.0 = 1.846 g. Rounding to 3 significant figures gives 1.85 g.",
