  "method": "Identify bonds broken in reactants: 4 C-H bonds in CH4 and 2 O=O bonds in 2O2. Energy required = (4 * 413) + (2 * 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ. Identify bonds formed in products: 2 C=O bonds in CO2 and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O. Energy released = (2 * 805) + (4 * 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ. Calculate deltaH = Energy required - Energy released = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
