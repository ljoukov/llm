  "method": "Identify the bonds broken in the reactants and bonds formed in the products for the reaction CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O. Bonds broken: 4 x C-H (4 * 413 = 1652 kJ/mol) and 2 x O=O (2 * 498 = 996 kJ/mol). Total energy required to break bonds = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ/mol. Bonds formed: 2 x C=O (2 * 805 = 1610 kJ/mol) and 4 x O-H (4 * 463 = 1852 kJ/mol). Total energy released from forming bonds = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ/mol. Calculate the enthalpy change using deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ/mol.",
