  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of NO2 and N2O4. [NO2] = moles(NO2) / V = 0.180 / 2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = moles(N2O4) / V = 0.220 / 2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. The expression for the equilibrium constant is Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Substituting the concentrations: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110. Calculating the numerator: (0.0900)^2 = 0.00810. Then divide by the denominator: 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.073636.... Rounding to 3 significant figures gives Kc = 0.0736.",
