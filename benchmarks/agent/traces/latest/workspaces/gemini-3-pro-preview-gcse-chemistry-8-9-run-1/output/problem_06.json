  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations by dividing moles by volume (V = 2.00 dm3). [NO2] = 0.180 / 2.00 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 / 2.00 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Using the expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4], calculate Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.073636... The result is 0.0736 (to 3 s.f.).",

  "checks": [
    "Since [NO2] is less than [N2O4] and it is squared, the numerator is small. The denominator is larger than numerator squared. So Kc should be small (< 1).",
    "0.09^2 is approx 0.008. 0.008 / 0.11 is approx 0.07. Matches result."
