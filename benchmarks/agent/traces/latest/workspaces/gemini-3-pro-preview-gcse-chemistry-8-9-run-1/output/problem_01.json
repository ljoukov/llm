  "method": "First, we identify the initial concentration c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume V1 = 25.0 cm3. The final volume V2 is given as 250.0 cm3. Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, we can rearrange to solve for the final concentration c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values, c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0. Calculating the numerator gives 5.0. Dividing by 250.0 results in 0.0200 mol dm-3. We ensure the volume units match (both in cm3 is fine for the ratio, or we could convert both to dm3). The result is 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
