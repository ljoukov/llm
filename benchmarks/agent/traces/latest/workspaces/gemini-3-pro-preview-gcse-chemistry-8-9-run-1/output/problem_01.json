  "method": "We are given an initial volume V1 of 25.0 cm3 and an initial concentration c1 of 0.200 mol dm-3. The solution is diluted to a final volume V2 of 250.0 cm3. Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, we can solve for the final concentration c2. Rearranging the equation gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0. This simplifies to 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. Since the dilution factor is 10 (25 to 250), the concentration should decrease by a factor of 10, which matches our result.",
