  "method": "We are given the initial volume V1 = 25.0 cm3 and initial concentration c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3. The solution is diluted to a final volume V2 = 250.0 cm3. Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, we can solve for the final concentration c2. c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
