  "method": "First, calculate the total charge passed using the formula Q = I * t. The time must be converted to seconds: 30.0 min * 60 s/min = 1800 s. Q = 1.50 * 1800 = 2700 C. Next, find the moles of electrons using n(e-) = Q / F, where F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol-1). n(e-) = 2700 / 96500 = 0.027979... mol. From the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of Cu. Therefore, n(Cu) = n(e-) / 2 = 0.013989... mol. Finally, calculate the mass of copper deposited using mass = n * Ar. With Ar(Cu) = 63.55, mass = 0.013989... * 63.55 = 0.889 g.",
