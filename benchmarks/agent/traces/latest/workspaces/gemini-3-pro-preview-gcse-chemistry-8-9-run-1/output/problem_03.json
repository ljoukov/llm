  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH using c = n/V: n(NaOH) = 0.150 * (23.40/1000) = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the ratio is 1:2. So n(H2SO4) = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Calculate concentration of H2SO4: c = n/V = 0.001755 / (25.00/1000) = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Since 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of H2SO4, and volumes are similar, the concentration of H2SO4 should be roughly half of NaOH.",
    "0.150 / 2 = 0.075. 0.0702 is close to 0.075."
