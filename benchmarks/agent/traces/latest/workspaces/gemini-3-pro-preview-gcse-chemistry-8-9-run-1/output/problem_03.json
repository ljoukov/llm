  "method": "Calculate the moles of NaOH using the given volume (23.40 cm3) and concentration (0.150 mol dm-3). n(NaOH) = 0.150 * 0.02340 = 0.003510 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, we see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of H2SO4. Therefore, n(H2SO4) = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.003510 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4 by dividing the moles by the volume (25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3). c(H2SO4) = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
