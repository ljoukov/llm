  "headline": "Intratumoral mRNA vaccines boost tumor antigen presentation and improve checkpoint inhibitor outcomes in mice and humans",
  "plain_language_summary": "The study shows that delivering an mRNA vaccine directly into tumours triggers a strong local immune response, increasing the variety of tumour proteins displayed to the immune system and raising type‑I interferon activity. In mouse models, this makes anti‑PD‑L1 therapy more effective, cutting tumour growth. In a retrospective analysis of 130 metastatic cancer patients, those who had received a SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA vaccine before starting checkpoint inhibitor therapy lived longer, with a statistically significant survival advantage (p=0.01). However, the human data are observational, and the timing of vaccination varied, so the results need confirmation in prospective trials.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "mRNA vaccination directly in tumours expands the immunopeptidome, increasing antigen visibility for T cells.",
    "Combination of intratumoral mRNA vaccine with anti‑PD‑L1 markedly improves tumour control in mouse models.",
    "Retrospective human data suggest prior SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA vaccination is associated with better survival under checkpoint blockade."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human cohort analysis is retrospective and not randomised, so confounding factors may drive the observed survival benefit.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to checkpoint therapy varied among patients, potentially influencing outcomes.",
    "Findings from mouse models may not fully translate to the diversity of human cancers."
