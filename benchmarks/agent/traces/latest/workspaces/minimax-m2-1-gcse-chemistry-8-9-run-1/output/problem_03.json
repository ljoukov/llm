  "method": "Calculate moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = concentration × volume = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40 cm3 / 1000) = 0.150 × 0.02340 = 0.003510 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio is 1:2, meaning 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. So moles of H2SO4 = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.003510 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Calculate concentration of H2SO4: c = n / V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00 cm3 / 1000) = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
