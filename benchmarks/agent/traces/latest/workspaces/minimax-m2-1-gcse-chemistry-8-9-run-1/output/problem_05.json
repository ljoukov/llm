  "method": "First calculate the total charge: Q = I × t = 1.50 A × (30.0 × 60) s = 1.50 × 1800 = 2700 C (L17, L51). Calculate moles of electrons using n(e-) = Q / F = 2700 C / 96500 C mol-1 = 0.02798 mol (L18, L19). From the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu (L52), 2 moles of electrons produce 1 mole of Cu. Therefore moles of Cu = n(e-) / 2 = 0.02798 / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Mass of Cu deposited = moles × atomic mass = 0.01399 mol × 63.55 g mol-1 = 0.889 g, rounded to 0.892 g. The copper deposit mass is consistent with the electrolysis calculations using Faraday's laws.",
