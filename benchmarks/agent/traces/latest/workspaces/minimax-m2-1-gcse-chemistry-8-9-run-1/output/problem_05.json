  "method": "First calculate the total charge passed: Convert time to seconds: 30.0 min = 30.0 × 60 = 1800 s. Calculate charge: Q = I × t = 1.50 A × 1800 s = 2700 C. Calculate moles of electrons: n(e-) = Q / F = 2700 C / 96500 C mol-1 = 0.027979 mol. From the half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu, 2 moles of electrons produce 1 mole of Cu. So moles of Cu = n(e-) / 2 = 0.027979 / 2 = 0.013989 mol. Calculate mass of copper deposited: m = n × atomic mass = 0.013989 mol × 63.55 g mol-1 = 0.889 g.",

    "Time was correctly converted from minutes to seconds (30.0 min × 60 = 1800 s).",
    "The Faraday constant 96500 C mol-1 from line 19 was used correctly.",
    "The stoichiometry from the half-equation (2 electrons per Cu atom) was correctly applied.",
    "The final mass 0.889 g has been reported to 3 significant figures, consistent with the input data."
