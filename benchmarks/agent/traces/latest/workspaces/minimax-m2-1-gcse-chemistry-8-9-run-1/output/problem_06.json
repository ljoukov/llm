Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. Using moles directly gives Kc = (0.180)^2 / (0.220 × 2.00) = 0.0324 / 0.440 = 0.0736."

  "method": "The equilibrium constant expression for N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g) is Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Calculate concentrations from the given moles and volume. For NO2: concentration = moles / volume = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. For N2O4: concentration = moles / volume = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Substitute into the Kc expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The Kc value is dimensionless as specified in line 21.",

    "The equilibrium expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] correctly reflects the stoichiometry of the reaction (1 mole N2O4 produces 2 moles NO2).",

    "The Kc value of 0.0736 has been calculated correctly and is reported as dimensionless according to the report instructions."
