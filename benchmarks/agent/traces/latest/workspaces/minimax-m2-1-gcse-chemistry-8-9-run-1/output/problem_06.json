  "method": "For the equilibrium N2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g) (L56), calculate concentrations from moles and volume: [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3, [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3 (L57, L58). Using Kc expression from L20: Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.008100 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The equilibrium constant Kc is unitless as noted in L21. Comparing reactant and product concentrations confirms the equilibrium lies toward the reactant side (N2O4), which is consistent with the small Kc value.",

    "Result is reasonable: Kc < 1 indicates equilibrium favors reactants (N2O4), consistent with higher reactant moles"
