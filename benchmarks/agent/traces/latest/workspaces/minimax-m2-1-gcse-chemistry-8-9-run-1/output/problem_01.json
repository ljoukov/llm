  },
  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2 where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3, V1 = 25.0 cm3, and V2 = 250.0 cm3. Convert the dilution formula to solve for c2: c2 = c1 × V1 / V2. Substitute the values: c2 = 0.200 × (25.0 / 250.0) = 0.200 × 0.100 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The new concentration is 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "The dilution factor is 250.0/25.0 = 10, so the concentration should decrease by a factor of 10 from 0.200 to 0.0200 mol dm-3, which matches the calculation.",
    "The answer has been reported to 3 significant figures, consistent with the input data (25.0, 250.0, and 0.200 all have 3 significant figures)."
