  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2 from line L16, where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 (L29), V1 = 25.0 cm3 (L29), and V2 = 250.0 cm3 (L29). Converting volumes to the same units, V1/V2 = 25.0/250.0 = 0.100. Therefore c2 = c1 × V1/V2 = 0.200 × 0.100 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The dilution factor is exactly 10 times, confirming the concentration is reduced by one order of magnitude.",

    "Dilution factor of 10 (250/25) correctly reduces concentration by factor of 10: 0.200/10 = 0.0200",
    "Units remain consistent: cm3 units cancel, result in mol dm-3",
    "Answer is reasonable: diluted concentration is lower than original, as expected in dilution"
