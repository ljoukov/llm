  },
  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2 where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 and V1 = 25.0 cm3 are transferred and diluted to V2 = 250.0 cm3. Convert volumes maintain ratio (cm3 units cancel). Rearranging: c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2. Substitute values: (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0. Calculate numerator: 5.00. Divide by denominator: 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200. Check: dilution factor is 10× (250/25), so concentration reduces by factor of 10, from 0.200 to 0.0200. Volume units must be consistent; cm3 ratio gives dimensionless factor. Final answer in mol dm-3 matches input concentration unit.",
