  "method": "First calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the 5.00 g sample: mass(CaCO3) = 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Then calculate moles of CaCO3: n = m / Mr = 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 = 0.041958 mol. From the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CO2. So moles of CO2 = 0.041958 mol. Finally calculate mass of CO2: m = n × Mr = 0.041958 mol × 44.0 g mol-1 = 1.846 g, which rounds to 1.85 g.",
