        "P06 has an internal contradiction: `final_answer.value` is 0.0366, but the worked calculation in both `precision_note` and `method` gives Kc = 0.0736 from the reported data (L55–L59, using Kc expression at L20–L21). This makes the final reported value unfaithful/unreliable for downstream use.",
        "P04 also has a mismatch between the reported `final_answer.value` (-810) and the calculation shown (-814) in both `precision_note` and `method` (from bond energies at L46 and formula at L47). While rounding could be acceptable, it is not explicitly reconciled, reducing practical usefulness and risking confusion in review.",
        "Multiple outputs include more line references than typical constrained schemas allow (e.g., P02/P03/P05/P06 list >4 refs). Even if the line numbers themselves are valid (they do map to existing report lines), this harms downstream usability where a strict validator is expected (the provided validation flags also indicate schema/grounding failures)."

      "summary": "Most problems (P01, P02, P03, P05) use only report-provided equations/constants (L14–L19) and produce numerically correct results consistent with the prompt data and stoichiometry (L28–L53). However, P06 reports an incorrect final Kc value relative to its own computation and the report inputs (L55–L59), which is a core quantitative outcome. P04’s displayed final value is not aligned with its shown calculation. Because the task is quantitative and downstream review depends on the `final_answer`字段"
