  "major_limitations": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, introducing potential residual confounding that could affect outcome interpretation.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients, creating heterogeneity in treatment sequencing that may influence results.",
    "Tumor-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity across the human cohort limit direct causal interpretation of the vaccination effect.",
    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumors due to species differences in tumor biology and immune responses.",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems rather than uniformly across all tested settings, suggesting context-dependent effects."
