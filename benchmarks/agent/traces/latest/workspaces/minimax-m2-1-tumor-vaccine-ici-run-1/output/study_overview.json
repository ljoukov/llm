  "major_limitations": [
    "Human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, introducing potential residual confounding factors that limit causal inference",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients, potentially affecting treatment outcomes and consistency",
    "Heterogeneous mix of tumor types and treatment histories across the patient cohort complicates direct interpretation of results",
    "Mouse model findings may not translate directly to all human tumor types and clinical settings",
    "Some mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems rather than being uniformly consistent across all tested experimental settings"
