The research combined laboratory studies in mice with analysis of human patient records. In mice, the researchers found that intratumoral mRNA vaccination created an inflammatory environment that increased the display of tumor markers on cell surfaces and boosted immune cell infiltration. Importantly, PD-L1 levels (the target of many immunotherapy drugs) also increased after vaccination, making the combination with checkpoint inhibitors more effective. Looking back at medical records of 130 cancer patients who received immunotherapy, those who had previously received an mRNA vaccine (like those for COVID-19) showed better survival outcomes than those who had not been vaccinated. However, the human analysis was not a randomized trial, so other factors could explain the difference.

The report (L39) supports that blockade eliminated the sensitization benefit, but 'proving' is stronger than warranted; it should be phrased as 'consistent with a requirement' or 'supports necessity' rather than definitive proof.",

However, the overall output set fails because claim_audit.json is explicitly schema/grounding invalid and contains an invalid line reference (\"L21-L23\"), violating the requirement for valid, mappable line refs. Additionally, some claims are overstated (e.g., 'пр"
