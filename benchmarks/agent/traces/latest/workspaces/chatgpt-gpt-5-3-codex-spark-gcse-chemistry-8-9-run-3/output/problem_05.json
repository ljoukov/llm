    "value": 0.889,
    "units": "g",
    "precision_note": "3 significant figures from current/time and molar mass data -> mass(Cu)=0.889 g."
  },
  "method": "Find the total charge passed from current and time using Q = It. Convert that to moles of electrons with n(e−)=Q/F. Use the cathode half-reaction Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu, so moles of copper deposited are half the moles of electrons. Multiply by molar mass of copper to obtain the mass.",
  "key_equations": [
    "Q = I × t",
    "n(e-) = Q / F",
    "n(Cu) = n(e-) / 2",
    "m = n × Mr"
  ],
  "line_refs": ["L17", "L19", "L51", "L52"],
  "checks": [
    "t=30.0 min = 1800 s, so Q=1.50×1800=2700 C.",
    "n(e-)=2700/96500=0.02798 mol e-, hence n(Cu)=0.01399 mol Cu and m=0.01399×63.55≈0.889 g."
