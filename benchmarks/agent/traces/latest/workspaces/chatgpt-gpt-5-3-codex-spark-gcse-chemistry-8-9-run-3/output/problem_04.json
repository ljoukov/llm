  "method": "Use the bond-energy Hess estimate: energy required to break bonds minus energy released in forming bonds. For reactants, break all C–H and O=O bonds listed in the reaction equation. For products, form C=O bonds in CO2 and O–H bonds in water. Sum each side and take ΔH = sum(broken) − sum(formed), keeping the sign convention from the equation provided.",
  "key_equations": [
    "ΔH = Σ(bonds broken) − Σ(bonds formed)",
    "bonds broken = 4(C−H)+2(O=O)",
    "bonds formed = 2(C=O)+4(O−H)"
