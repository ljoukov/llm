    "value": 0.0702,
    "units": "mol dm-3",
    "precision_note": "4 significant figures from 23.40 cm3 and 25.00 cm3 with 0.150 mol dm-3, so c(H2SO4)=0.0702 mol dm-3."
  },
  "method": "Find moles of NaOH from its concentration and volume. Using the balanced equation, moles of H2SO4 are half that of NaOH because one H2SO4 requires 2 NaOH. Divide the acid moles by its sample volume (in dm3) to get the concentration.",
