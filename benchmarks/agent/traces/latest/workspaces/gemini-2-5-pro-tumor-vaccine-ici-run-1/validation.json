This approach triggered a strong immune response within the tumor, making it more visible to the immune system. When combined with ICI therapy, this led to better tumor control. The study also looked at a group of cancer patients who had received ICIs. It found that those who had previously been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 with mRNA vaccines seemed to have better outcomes.

The claim_audit.json is mostly aligned with the mechanistic chain (L41–L46) and caveats (L48–L53), though it adds at least one ungrounded caveat detail. However, the public_summary.json fails schema validation and is flagged as not grounded; it also lacks any line references to支持"
