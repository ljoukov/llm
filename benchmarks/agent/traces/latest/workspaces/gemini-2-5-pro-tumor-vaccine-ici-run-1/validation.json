This led to better tumor control when combined with an ICI.

        "Invalid/insufficient evidence line mapping for key claims in claim_audit.json: Claim C05 asserts that the combination “improves tumor control in mice and aligns with better outcomes in the retrospective human cohort,” but its evidence line refs are L30 (human survival p-value) and L33 (CD8+ T-cell density). Neither L30 nor L33 supports the “improves tumor control in mice” part; the report’s explicit statement about improved mouse tumor control is in the mechanistic chain summary (L46). This violates the requirement that line references be valid and map to the report lines supporting the claim.",
        "Overstated certainty labels in claim_audit.json given the report’s framing: multiple mechanistic steps are tagged as “strong” (e.g., C04, C05) even though the report notes heterogeneity of mechanistic readouts across model systems (L53) and emphasizes that human evidence is retrospective/non-causal (L49–L52, L55–L56). The qualitative “strong” grading is not well-calibrated to the stated caveats.",
        "study_overview.json and public_summary.json are flagged as groundingValid:false/schemaValid:false in the provided validation results, and the content issues reflect that: several cohort descriptions are too minimal (“43 patients.” / “87 patients.”), reducing downstream utility for review and cohort interpretation (even if numerically consistent with L21–L23).",
        "Public-facing statements sometimes imply broader efficacy than supported: public_summary.json says the approach “led to better tumor control when combined with an ICI” without explicitly reminding readers that vaccine-only and ICI-only had limited/did-not-durably-control outcomes in certain models (L36–L37) and that mechanistic effects were not uniform across settings (L53). This is partly mitigated by the caution section, but the main summary could be misread as more general than the report supports."

However, the submission fails strict grading because at least one core synthesized claim (claim_audit C05) is not properly grounded by its cited line references (mouse tumor control is not supported by"
