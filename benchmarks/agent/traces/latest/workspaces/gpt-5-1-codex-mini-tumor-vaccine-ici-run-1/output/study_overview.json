  "major_limitations": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, so residual confounding is likely present.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients, limiting temporal clarity.",
    "Tumor-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity make it hard to interpret group differences causally.",
    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumors tested clinically."
