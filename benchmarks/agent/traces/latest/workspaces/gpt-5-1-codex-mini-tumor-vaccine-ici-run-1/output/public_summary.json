  "headline": "SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination primes tumors for PD-L1 blockade in mice and human cohorts",
  "plain_language_summary": "Researchers tested whether injecting SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine directly into tumors could create an inflammatory state that makes anti-PD-L1 therapies more effective. In mice the vaccine broadened the immunopeptidome and MHC-I landscape, raised PD-L1 and CD8+ density, and improved combination efficacy while vaccine-only or ICI-only arms failed to control non-immunogenic tumors, lipid particle controls lacking mRNA did not reproduce the effect, and blocking IFNAR1 eliminated the sensitization benefit. A retrospective cohort of 43 vaccinated versus 87 unvaccinated metastatic patients on ICI also showed better survival for vaccinated individuals, although the human data remain observational and heterogeneous.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Intratumoral SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination broadened tumor antigen display and MHC-I presentation in murine models.",
    "The vaccine plus anti-PD-L1 combination raised PD-L1 expression and CD8+ T cell density, supporting stronger murine tumor control.",
    "Vaccinated metastatic patients on ICI showed statistically better survival than unvaccinated peers in the retrospective cohort."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, so residual confounding is likely present.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients, limiting temporal clarity.",
    "Tumor-type mix and treatment-history heterogeneity make it hard to interpret group differences causally.",
    "Mouse model effects may not map one-to-one to all human tumors tested clinically."
