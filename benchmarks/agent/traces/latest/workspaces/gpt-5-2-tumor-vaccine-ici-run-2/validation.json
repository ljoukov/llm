This study explored whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor could create a local inflammatory signal dominated by type I interferons, which can boost antigen processing and presentation. In mouse tumor models, the authors report changes consistent with stronger immune priming, including broader peptide display on MHC-I and increased markers linked to responsiveness to anti-PD-L1 therapy. The paper also includes a retrospective (non-randomized) analysis of metastatic patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors, comparing outcomes by prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination status, where a survival difference is reported.
