  "headline": "Injecting an mRNA vaccine into tumors may boost response to checkpoint immunotherapy",
  "plain_language_summary": "Many cancers do not respond well to immune checkpoint inhibitors because the immune system is not strongly activated inside the tumor. This study tested the idea that putting an mRNA vaccine directly into a tumor could create a short-lived, interferon-driven inflammatory state that helps the immune system “see” the cancer and makes anti-PD-L1 therapy work better. In mouse tumor models, the authors report signs of stronger immune activation, including higher type I interferon signaling, broader antigen presentation on MHC-I, increased PD-L1 pathway activity, and more CD8+ T cells in tumors with the combination approach. The paper also reports a retrospective analysis of metastatic patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors in which those who previously received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination had better survival (p=0.01). However, the human evidence is observational and could be affected by differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, so prospective randomized trials are needed before changing clinical practice.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The paper links intratumoral mRNA vaccination to broader tumor antigen presentation on MHC-I.",
    "It proposes a type I interferon–driven mechanism that can make tumors more responsive to anti-PD-L1 therapy.",
    "It reports an association between prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and improved survival under ICI in a retrospective cohort."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis is retrospective and non-randomized, so it cannot prove causation.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to immunotherapy varied and could influence the observed association.",
    "Mouse model results may not translate directly to all human tumor types and clinical settings.",
    "Tumor-type and prior-treatment heterogeneity can complicate interpretation of biomarkers and outcomes."
