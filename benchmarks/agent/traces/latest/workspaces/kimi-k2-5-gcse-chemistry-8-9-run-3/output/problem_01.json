  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where the initial concentration c1 is 0.200 mol dm-3, initial volume V1 is 25.0 cm3, and final volume V2 is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging to find the final concentration: c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 × 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The dilution factor is 10, so the concentration decreases by a factor of 10.",
