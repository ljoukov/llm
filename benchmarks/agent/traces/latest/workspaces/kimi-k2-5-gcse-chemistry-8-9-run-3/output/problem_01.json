  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, rearrange to find the new concentration: c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2. Substitute values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 × 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3. Since both volumes are in the same units (cm3), the ratio applies directly: c2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. This represents a 10-fold dilution as expected when 25.0 cm3 is diluted to 250.0 cm3.",
