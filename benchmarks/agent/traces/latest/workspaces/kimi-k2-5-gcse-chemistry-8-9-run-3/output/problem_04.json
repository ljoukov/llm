    "value": -812,

  },
  "method": "Apply the bond energy formula ΔH = Σ(bonds broken) - Σ(bonds formed). For the reaction CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O: Bonds broken are 4 C-H bonds (4 × 413 = 1652 kJ) and 2 O=O bonds (2 × 498 = 996 kJ), giving total broken = 2650 kJ. Bonds formed are 2 C=O bonds in CO2 (2 × 805 = 1610 kJ) and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O (4 × 463 = 1852 kJ), giving total formed = 3462 kJ. Therefore ΔH = 2650 - 3462 = -812 kJ mol-1. The negative value indicates an exothermic reaction, consistent with combustion.",
