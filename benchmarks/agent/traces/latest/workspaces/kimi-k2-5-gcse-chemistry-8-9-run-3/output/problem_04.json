  "method": "For the combustion CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O, calculate energy for bonds broken and formed. Bonds broken in reactants: 4 C-H bonds (4 × 413 = 1652 kJ/mol) and 2 O=O bonds (2 × 498 = 996 kJ/mol), total = 2648 kJ/mol. Bonds formed in products: 2 C=O bonds in CO2 (2 × 805 = 1610 kJ/mol) and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O (4 × 463 = 1852 kJ/mol), total = 3462 kJ/mol. Using deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed): deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ/mol. The negative value indicates an exothermic reaction.",
