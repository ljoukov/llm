  "method": "For the equilibrium N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g) in a 2.00 dm3 vessel, first calculate equilibrium concentrations. [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Using Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The equilibrium constant is reported as dimensionless as specified.",
