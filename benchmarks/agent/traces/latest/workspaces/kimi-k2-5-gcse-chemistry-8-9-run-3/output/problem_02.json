  "method": "First calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g CaCO3. Then calculate moles of CaCO3 using n = m/Mr with Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1: n = 4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.04196 mol. From the stoichiometric equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the mole ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so moles of CO2 = 0.04196 mol. Finally, calculate mass of CO2 using m = n × Mr with Mr(CO2) = 44.0: m = 0.04196 mol × 44.0 g/mol = 1.846 g, which rounds to 1.85 g to 3 significant figures.",
