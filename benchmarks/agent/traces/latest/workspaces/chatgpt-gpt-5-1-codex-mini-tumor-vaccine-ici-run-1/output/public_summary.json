  "headline": "Intratumoral mRNA vaccination may boost checkpoint blockade sensitivity in tumors",
  "plain_language_summary": "In preclinical mouse models, intratumoral delivery of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine triggers type I interferon signaling, broadens the tumor immunopeptidome, and enhances PD-L1 targetability and CD8+ infiltration, aligning with an association between prior vaccination and better survival in a retrospective metastatic patient cohort. Vaccine-only or ICI-only controls showed limited durable benefit, underscoring that the observed tumor sensitization required the combination approach.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "Intratumoral SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces local innate sensing and IFN-driven antigen processing, potentially explaining the broadened peptide repertoire on MHC-I.",
    "Broad antigen presentation and increased PD-L1 expression in mouse tumors create a biological rationale for pairing the vaccine with anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade.",
    "A retrospective human cohort links prior SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination with improved survival under ICI, consistent with the mouse combination findings.
"  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human analysis was retrospective, non-randomized, and likely residual confounding remains, so associations rather than causality are supported.",
    "Vaccine-only treatment did not produce durable tumor control in non-immunogenic models, indicating the benefit depends on the combination regimen.",
    "ICI-only treatment had limited activity in low-immunogenic baselines, so improved outcomes cannot be attributed to ICI alone in these settings.",
    "Mouse model effects may not translate directly to all human tumors due to species and tumor-type differences."
