  "method": "To calculate the mass of copper deposited, the total electric charge (Q) is first determined using the formula Q = I * t. The time is converted to seconds (30.0 min * 60 s/min = 1800 s), and multiplied by the current (1.50 A) to give 2700 C. The moles of electrons are then calculated using n(e-) = Q / F, yielding 2700 / 96500 = 0.02798 mol. The half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu indicates that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper, meaning 0.01399 moles of Cu are formed. Finally, the mass is found by multiplying the moles by the atomic mass of copper (63.55), resulting in 0.889 g.",
