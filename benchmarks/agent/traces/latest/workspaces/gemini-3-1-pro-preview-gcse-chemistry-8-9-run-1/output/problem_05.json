  "method": "First, find the total charge (Q) passed through the cell by multiplying the current (I = 1.50 A) by the time in seconds (t = 30.0 * 60 = 1800 s), which gives Q = 1.50 * 1800 = 2700 C. Next, calculate the moles of electrons transferred by dividing the total charge by the Faraday constant (F = 96,500 C mol-1): n(e-) = 2700 / 96500 = 0.027979 moles of electrons. According to the cathodic half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu, 2 moles of electrons are needed to deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore, the moles of copper produced is 0.027979 / 2 = 0.013989 moles. Finally, convert this to mass using the molar mass of copper (63.55 g mol-1): m = 0.013989 * 63.55 = 0.889 g.",
