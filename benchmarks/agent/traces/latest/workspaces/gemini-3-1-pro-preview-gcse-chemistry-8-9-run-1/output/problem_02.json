  "method": "First, the mass of pure calcium carbonate in the limestone sample is determined by multiplying the total sample mass (5.00 g) by its purity (84.0%), yielding 4.20 g of CaCO3. Next, the moles of CaCO3 are calculated using the formula n = m / Mr, with the relative molecular mass of CaCO3 (100.1) giving approximately 0.04196 moles. According to the balanced chemical equation, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, meaning 0.04196 moles of CO2 will be produced. Finally, the mass of CO2 is found by multiplying its moles by its relative molecular mass (44.0), resulting in approximately 1.85 g of CO2.",
