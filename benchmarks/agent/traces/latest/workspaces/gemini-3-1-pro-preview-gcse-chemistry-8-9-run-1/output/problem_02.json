  "method": "Calculate the pure mass of calcium carbonate by multiplying the limestone sample mass (5.00 g) by its purity percentage (84.0%), yielding 4.20 g of CaCO3. Use the molar mass of CaCO3 (100.1) to find the moles of CaCO3: n = m / Mr = 4.20 / 100.1 = 0.041958 mol. From the balanced chemical equation, CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so 0.041958 moles of CO2 are produced. Finally, calculate the maximum mass of CO2 produced by multiplying the moles of CO2 by its molar mass (44.0): m = n * Mr = 0.041958 * 44.0 = 1.846 g. Round the result to 3 significant figures.",
