  "method": "First, determine the equilibrium concentrations of both the reactant and the product by dividing their moles by the volume of the reaction vessel (2.00 dm3). The concentration of NO2 is 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3, and the concentration of N2O4 is 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. The equilibrium constant expression for the reaction N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g) is Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Substitute the calculated concentrations into this expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.073636... Rounding the result to 3 significant figures yields an equilibrium constant of 0.0736. As stated in the report, Kc is reported as dimensionless.",
