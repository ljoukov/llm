  "method": "To calculate the equilibrium constant Kc, we first find the equilibrium concentrations of both gases by dividing their moles by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3). The concentration of NO2 is 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3, and the concentration of N2O4 is 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Next, these concentration values are substituted into the equilibrium expression for the reaction, which is Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Squaring the NO2 concentration gives 0.00810, and dividing by the N2O4 concentration yields approximately 0.0736. As instructed, the final answer is reported as dimensionless.",

    "Moles were converted to concentrations using the 2.00 dm3 vessel volume before plugging into the Kc expression.",
    "The concentration of NO2 was correctly squared in the numerator of the equilibrium constant formula.",
    "The final value was rounded to 3 significant figures to match the precision of the input moles and volume."
