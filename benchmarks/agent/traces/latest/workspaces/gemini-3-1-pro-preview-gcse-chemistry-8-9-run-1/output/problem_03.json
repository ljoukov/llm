  "method": "First, determine the moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used in the titration by applying the formula n = c * V. Using the given concentration (0.150 mol dm-3) and volume converted to dm3 (23.40 / 1000 = 0.0234 dm3), we get 0.150 * 0.0234 = 0.00351 moles of NaOH. According to the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the molar ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Thus, the moles of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is half that of NaOH, which equals 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 moles. Lastly, find the concentration of H2SO4 by dividing its moles by its volume in dm3 (25.00 / 1000 = 0.02500 dm3). The result is c = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
