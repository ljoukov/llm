  "method": "To find the concentration of H2SO4, we first calculate the moles of NaOH used in the titration. Using the formula c = n / V and converting the volume to dm3, the moles of NaOH is 0.150 mol dm-3 * 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. The balanced chemical equation shows that 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH, so the moles of H2SO4 is half that of NaOH, which is 0.001755 mol. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 is calculated by dividing its moles by its volume in dm3 (0.02500 dm3), resulting in 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Volumes were properly converted from cm3 to dm3 before calculating moles.",
    "The 1:2 molar ratio from the balanced equation was correctly applied to find the moles of acid.",
    "Final concentration was rounded to 3 significant figures, matching the precision of the NaOH concentration."
