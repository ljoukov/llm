  },
  "method": "The enthalpy change (deltaH) is estimated using the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). First, the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (CH4 and 2O2) is calculated. This involves breaking four C-H bonds (4 * 413 = 1652) and two O=O bonds (2 * 498 = 996), giving a total of 2648 kJ mol-1. Next, the energy released upon forming the products (CO2 and 2H2O) is calculated. This involves forming two C=O bonds (2 * 805 = 1610) and four O-H bonds (4 * 463 = 1852), giving a total of 3462 kJ mol-1. Subtracting the energy of formed bonds from the energy of broken bonds yields 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
