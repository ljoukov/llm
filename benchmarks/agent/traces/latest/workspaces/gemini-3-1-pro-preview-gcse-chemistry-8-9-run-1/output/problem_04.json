  "method": "To estimate the enthalpy change (deltaH) for the combustion of methane, use the formula: deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). First, calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (CH4 and 2O2). This involves breaking 4 C-H bonds and 2 O=O bonds, which equals (4 * 413) + (2 * 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Next, calculate the energy released when forming the bonds in the products (CO2 and 2H2O). This involves forming 2 C=O bonds and 4 O-H bonds, which equates to (2 * 805) + (4 * 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. Finally, subtract the energy of the bonds formed from the bonds broken: 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
