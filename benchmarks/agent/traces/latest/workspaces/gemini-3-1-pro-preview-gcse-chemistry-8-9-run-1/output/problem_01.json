  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2. The initial concentration c1 is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume V1 is 25.0 cm3. The final volume V2 is 250.0 cm3. Substituting the values into the equation gives 0.200 * 25.0 = c2 * 250.0. Solving for c2 yields c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
