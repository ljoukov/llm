  "method": "To calculate the new concentration of HCl, we use the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The final volume (V2) after dilution with water is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging the formula to solve for the final concentration gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the provided values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3. The volumes can be kept in cm3 as their units cancel out. The calculation yields c2 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
