  "method": "Use the dilution relationship c1V1 = c2V2. The initial concentration is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the technician transfers 25.0 cm3, then makes up to a final volume of 250.0 cm3. Because V1 and V2 are in the same units, the ratio V1/V2 can be used directly: c2 = c1 × (V1/V2) = 0.200 × (25.0/250.0) = 0.200 × 0.100 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
