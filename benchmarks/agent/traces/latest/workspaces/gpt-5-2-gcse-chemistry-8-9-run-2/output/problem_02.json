  "method": "Work from the pure CaCO3 content. The sample mass is 5.00 g and it is 84.0% CaCO3, so m(CaCO3) = 5.00 × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Convert to moles using the given molar mass: n(CaCO3) = 4.20 g ÷ 100.1 g mol-1 = 0.04196 mol. From the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, 1 mol CaCO3 produces 1 mol CO2, so n(CO2) = 0.04196 mol. Convert to mass with Mr(CO2) = 44.0: m(CO2) = 0.04196 × 44.0 = 1.848 g, which rounds to 1.85 g (3 s.f.).",

    "Only 4.20 g of CaCO3 is present, so CO2 produced must be less than 4.20 g; 1.85 g is reasonable.",
    "The reaction shows a 1:1 mol ratio for CaCO3 to CO2, so moles of CO2 should equal moles of CaCO3."
