This study utilized the JWST MIRI instrument to capture the planet's thermal phase curve and spectrum. Researchers tested models with and without an atmosphere. The results show that a bare-rock, no-atmosphere model fails to explain both the observed non-zero heat redistribution across the planet (epsilon = 0.19) and the spectral feature detected near 15 µm, which is consistent with CO2 absorption. Atmosphere-bearing models fit the combined data products much better, with a likelihood ratio of 7.4. The planet's dayside is hot (342 ± 22 K), and it is very dark (Bond albedo <0.08). The key takeaway is that the dataset provides meaningful evidence against a strictly airless interpretation for TRAPPIST-1 b, suggesting the presence of an atmosphere.
