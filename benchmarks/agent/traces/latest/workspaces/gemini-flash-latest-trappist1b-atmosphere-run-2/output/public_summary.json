  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is a rocky, Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting a cool dwarf star. Due to its close orbit and strong stellar irradiation, a major question in exoplanet science has been whether it could retain any atmosphere. This study used the James Webb Space Telescope's MIRI instrument to observe the planet's thermal phase curve, which measures how the temperature changes as the planet orbits. The results show significant evidence against a completely bare, airless rock surface. Key findings include a non-zero heat transport efficiency (epsilon approx 0.19), suggesting that heat is being moved from the hot day side to the colder night side, likely by an atmosphere. Furthermore, when combining the phase curve data with spectral features around 15 µm, atmosphere-bearing models are strongly favored over airless models (likelihood ratio of 7.4). While the exact composition and pressure are still uncertain—moderate-pressure, CO2-rich scenarios are plausible—the data conclusively show that a strictly airless interpretation is meaningfully challenged, paving the way for follow-up studies to characterize the atmosphere's precise nature.",

    "The study provides meaningful evidence against a strictly airless interpretation for TRAPPIST-1 b based on combined JWST MIRI phase curve and spectral data.",
    "The observation of non-zero heat transport suggests a mechanism, likely an atmosphere, is moving energy from the planet's day side to its night side, beyond simple bare-rock reradiation.",
    "The detection of spectral structure consistent with absorption near 15 µm provides the first composition-sensitive evidence, supporting a CO2-rich atmospheric component."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The current findings are derived from a single-planet study, so the existence of an atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 b does not confirm atmospheric prevalence on all M-dwarf rocky planets.",
    "Quantitative conclusions are sensitive to retrieval assumptions regarding atmospheric circulation, opacity priors, and the presence or absence of clouds or hazes.",
    "Night-side temperature and composition constraints are significantly weaker than those for the day side in the current dataset, limiting the full understanding of global circulation."
