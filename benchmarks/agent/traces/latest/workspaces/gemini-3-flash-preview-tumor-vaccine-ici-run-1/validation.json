ICIs are a type of cancer treatment that helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells, but they don't work for everyone. The researchers found that injecting mRNA vaccines directly into tumors (in mice) or having a history of vaccination (in humans) can trigger an inflammatory response involving type I interferon. This response makes the tumor more \\\"visible\\\" to the immune system by increasing the variety of tumor markers (antigens) presented on the surface of cancer cells and increasing the levels of PD-L1, which is the target for many ICIs.
