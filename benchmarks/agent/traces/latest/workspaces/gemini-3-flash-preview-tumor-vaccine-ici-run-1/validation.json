Many tumors do not respond to ICIs because they are \\\"hidden\\\" from the immune system or lack the necessary inflammatory signals. By injecting mRNA vaccines directly into tumors, the researchers found that they could trigger a strong interferon response, which in turn broadens the variety of tumor markers (antigens) displayed on the cell surface. This makes the tumor more visible to T cells. In mouse models, this combination therapy significantly improved tumor control.
