  "headline": "mRNA vaccines may prime tumors for better immune checkpoint blockade responses",
  "plain_language_summary": "Researchers have discovered that intratumoral delivery of mRNA vaccines can create a highly inflammatory state within tumors, specifically driven by type I interferon signaling. This inflammation enhances the processing and presentation of tumor antigens, making the cancer cells more visible to the immune system. As a result, the tumor's sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, such as anti-PD-L1 drugs, is significantly increased. Both mouse models and retrospective human data indicate improved outcomes when these treatments are combined.",
