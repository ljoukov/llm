  "headline": "JWST Detects Signs of Atmosphere on Rocky Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "This study used the James Webb Space Telescope to observe TRAPPIST-1 b, an Earth-sized rocky planet orbiting very close to its star. By measuring how the planet's thermal light varies throughout its orbit and analyzing its infrared spectrum, researchers found evidence that this world likely has an atmosphere. The data showed heat is being transported from the day side to the night side of the planet, something that would not happen on an airless world. The findings suggest TRAPPIST-1 b is not a bare rock but retains some atmospheric gases, though the exact composition and thickness remain uncertain and require more observations to confirm.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "First detection of day-night heat redistribution on TRAPPIST-1 b using JWST phase-curve observations, suggesting atmospheric heat transport.",
    "Joint analysis combining thermal phase variations with spectral structure near the 15-micron CO2 band to constrain atmospheric properties.",
    "Quantitative evidence against a strictly airless interpretation, with atmosphere-bearing models preferred over bare-rock models by a likelihood ratio of 7.4."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This study examines only one planet and cannot determine how common atmospheres are on rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars.",
    "Retrieval models depend on assumptions about atmospheric circulation, cloud properties, and opacity that affect the quantitative results.",
    "Weak spectral features can be biased by stellar variability and instrument systematics, creating uncertainty in the detection.",
    "The night side of the planet is less well constrained than the day side, leaving gaps in the complete atmospheric picture."

  "open_questions": [
    "What is the exact chemical composition of TRAPPIST-1 b's atmosphere, and how much CO2 versus other gases like O2 might be present?",
    "How thick is the atmosphere in terms of surface pressure, and is it a thin veil or a substantial envelope?",
    "Do clouds or hazes exist in the atmosphere, and how do they affect the observed thermal and spectral signals?",
    "Can similar atmospheres be detected on the other rocky planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system using extended observations?"
