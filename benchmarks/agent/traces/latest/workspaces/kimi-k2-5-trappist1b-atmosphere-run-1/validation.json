Because it is so close to its star, scientists have wondered whether it could hold onto any atmosphere or if stellar radiation would have stripped it away completely. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), researchers measured how the planet's heat varies as it orbits its star—what astronomers call a phase curve. They found that heat spreads from the planet's day side to its night side more effectively than expected for a bare rock without air, suggesting some atmosphere is present. Additionally, they detected weak spectral features near 15 micrometers wavelength that are consistent with carbon dioxide absorption. While these results provide meaningful evidence against a completely airless planet, the exact composition and thickness of any atmosphere remain uncertain. The study represents an important step in characterizing rocky planets around small stars, though follow-up observations are needed to better constrain atmospheric properties.\",\n  \"what_is_new\": [\n    \"This is the first JWST phase-curve spectroscopy study of TRAPPIST-1 b that jointly constrains both heat transport and atmospheric composition through thermal measurements and CO2 spectral features.\",\n    \"The detection of non-zero heat redistribution (epsilon = 0.19) suggests day-night energy transport that exceeds what a bare rock without atmosphere could produce.\",\n    \"The spectral signature around 15 micrometers indicates potential atmospheric absorption, providing composition-sensitive evidence alongside thermal phase curve constraints.\"\n  ],\n  \"why_caution_is_needed\": [\n    \"This study focuses on only one planet and cannot establish whether atmospheres are common or rare among rocky planets orbiting M dwarf stars.\",\n    \"The spectral features are weak and could be affected by stellar variability or instrument systematics, making the atmospheric composition detection tentative rather than definitive.\",\n    \"Multiple factors including cloud coverage, atmospheric circulation patterns, and gas composition create degeneracies that prevent precise determination of atmospheric properties.\",\n    \"Night-side measurements are less constrained than day-side data, limiting confidence in the full thermal redistribution picture.\"\n  ],\n  \"glossary\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Phase curve\",\n      \"definition\": \"A measurement of how a planet's brightness or temperature changes over its orbital period, revealing how heat is distributed across the planet's surface.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Heat redistribution efficiency (epsilon)\",\n      \"definition\": \"A parameter describing how effectively heat is transported from a planet's hot day side to its cooler night side; zero means no heat transport.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Bond albedo\",\n      \"definition\": \"The fraction of total incoming starlight that a planet reflects back into space across all wavelengths and directions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Tidally locked\",\n      \"definition\": \"A state where a planet always shows the same face to its star, resulting in a permanent day side and night side.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Retrieval model\",\n      \"definition\": \"A computational framework that uses observed data to infer atmospheric properties like temperature, pressure, and chemical composition.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"M dwarf\",\n      \"definition\": \"A small, cool star with less than half the mass of our Sun, around which many rocky exoplanets have been discovered.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"open_questions\": [\n    \"What is the exact composition and pressure of TRAPPIST-1 b's atmosphere, and can CO2-rich versus O2-rich scenarios be distinguished with future data?\",\n    \"Does TRAPPIST-1 b have clouds or hazes that could be masking or mimicking certain atmospheric signatures?\",\n    \"How common are atmospheres on rocky planets orbiting M dwarf stars, and what factors determine whether they survive intense stellar irradiation?\"\n  ]\n}\n"

While “evidence” is acceptable, “detects” reads more definitive than the report’s caveated stance.",

However, the overall submission fails because public_summary.json introduces an unsupported numeric orbital period and unsupported “first study” novelty language, and claim_audit.json does not meet the required schema/grounding constraints (and has insufficient evidence items for some rows"
