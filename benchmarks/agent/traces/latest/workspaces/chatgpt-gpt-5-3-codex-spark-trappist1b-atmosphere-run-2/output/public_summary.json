  "headline": "JWST phase-curve observations provide evidence for an atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "The study uses JWST MIRI phase-curve spectroscopy of the ultra-hot, tidally locked planet TRAPPIST-1 b to test whether it is airless. The retrieved dayside temperature is 342 +/- 22 K, and the heat transport parameter is reported as 0.19 (+0.23/-0.14), which they interpret as non-zero energy transport rather than instant re-radiation from the dayside only. They also find a 15 um CO2 spectral feature depth of about 96 ppm and a joint fit likelihood ratio of 7.4 that favors atmosphere-bearing models over bare-rock models. Even so, the preferred pressure range in CO2-rich retrievals is moderate (0.3-1.0 bar), and O2-rich cases remain a viable alternative under current data, so composition and pressure are still not pinned down. The authors therefore argue the evidence is meaningful but not yet final and call for follow-up observations.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "This is a joint test using both thermal phase variation and spectral shape, rather than relying on either phase curve or spectrum alone.",
    "The analysis reports non-zero heat transport (epsilon 0.19) and a moderate CO2-band signal, both supporting atmospheric behavior over a strict bare-rock limit.",
    "A quantitative model-comparison measure is provided (7.4 likelihood ratio), explicitly favoring atmosphere-bearing scenarios over no-atmosphere cases."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The study explicitly notes that O2-rich atmospheric cases are not fully ruled out, so composition is not uniquely fixed to CO2-rich atmospheres.",
    "Degeneracies remain among composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation assumptions, which can shift inferred pressures and transport properties.",
    "They describe weaker constraints on the night side than day side, reducing certainty about full longitudinal energy transport.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics are highlighted as possible biases for weak spectral features.",
    "This is a single-planet study, so it does not establish how common such atmospheres are across all M-dwarf rocky worlds."
