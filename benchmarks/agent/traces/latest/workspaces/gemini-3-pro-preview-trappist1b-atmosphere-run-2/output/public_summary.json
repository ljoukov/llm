  "headline": "JWST Finds Hints of an Atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "TRAPPIST-1 b is an Earth-sized rocky planet orbiting a small red star. Astronomers used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to watch the planet as it moved around its star, measuring both the heat it emits and the specific colors of light associated with gases like carbon dioxide. The study found that the planet's day side is not as hot as expected for a bare rock, suggesting that winds might be moving heat to the night side. Additionally, the telescope detected a pattern of light around 15 microns that matches what we expect from carbon dioxide. When combining these clues, models with an atmosphere fit the data better than models without one. However, the evidence is not yet definitive proof, and more observations are needed to confirm the atmosphere's thickness and composition.",
