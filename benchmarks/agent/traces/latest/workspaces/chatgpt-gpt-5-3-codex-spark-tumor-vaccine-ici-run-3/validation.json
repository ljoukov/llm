While the report supports increased immunopeptidome/MHC-I breadth (L28–L29) and increased CD8 density (L33), the report also cautions that mechanistic readouts were strongest in specific model systems and not uniform (L53). A 'moderate' strength would be safer given the stated heterogeneity caveat."

However, the overall output fails because the public_summary file is invalid JSON and ungrounded per the provided validation flags, making the package incoherent and impractical for downstream automated or manual review.
