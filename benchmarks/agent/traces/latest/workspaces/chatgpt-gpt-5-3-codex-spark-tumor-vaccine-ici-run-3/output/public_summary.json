  "plain_language_summary": "This study explored whether delivering SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines directly into tumors could improve responses to anti-PD-L1. In mouse studies, the combination was linked to stronger antitumor signals such as broader antigen display and higher immune-cell presence. In a retrospective cohort of 130 metastatic patients (43 vaccinated and 87 unvaccinated), vaccinated patients had a reported survival association with ICI treatment (p=0.01). However, results are preliminary for humans because the cohort is retrospective and non-randomized, with varying vaccine timing and diverse cancers and treatment histories. Prospective trials are still needed before changing clinical practice.

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The human arm is retrospective and non-randomized, so causal claims are limited.",
    "Vaccination timing relative to ICI initiation varied across patients and could bias outcome comparisons.",
    "Not all mechanistic effects were universal across model systems, and mouse findings may not fully translate to humans.",
    "Residual confounding and tumor heterogeneity may explain part of the observed survival association.",
    "The study does not yet provide randomized clinical trial-level evidence for changing treatment protocols."
