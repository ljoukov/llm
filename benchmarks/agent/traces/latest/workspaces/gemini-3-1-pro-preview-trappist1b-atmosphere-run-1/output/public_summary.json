  "headline": "JWST Phase-Curve Evidence Suggests TRAPPIST-1 b May Retain an Atmosphere",
  "plain_language_summary": "Scientists used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe the Earth-sized planet TRAPPIST-1 b. They wanted to see if it still has an atmosphere despite the intense radiation from its star. By looking at how the planet emits heat as it orbits, they found that a model with no atmosphere doesn't fit the data well. Instead, the data suggests that some heat is moved from the day side to the night side, and there are hints of carbon dioxide. This provides meaningful evidence against the planet being completely airless, but more observations are needed to be sure about its composition and pressure.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "JWST MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy was used to observe TRAPPIST-1 b's thermal phase variation.",
    "The study found a non-zero heat transport efficiency, suggesting heat redistribution.",
    "Atmosphere-bearing models, especially with CO2, better explain combined data than airless models."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This is a single-planet study and does not establish atmospheric prevalence across all M-dwarf rocky planets.",
    "Retrieval assumptions such as circulation and cloud treatment affect quantitative results.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics can bias weak spectral features.",
    "Degeneracies between composition, clouds, and circulation assumptions remain significant."
