  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations. The volume V is 2.00 dm3. [NO2] = n(NO2) / V = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = n(N2O4) / V = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Next, calculate Kc using the expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] (L20): Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.008100 / 0.110 = 0.073636... The result, 0.0736, is reported to 3 significant figures and is unitless as specified in the constraints (L21).",

  "checks": [
    "The concentrations calculated are [NO2] = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.110 mol dm-3. The ratio 0.0900^2 / 0.110 = 0.073636..., which confirms the result.",
    "The calculated value of Kc is less than 1, indicating that the equilibrium lies to the left, favoring the reactant N2O4."
