  "method": "The equilibrium constant (Kc) is calculated using the expression $K_c = [\\text{NO}_2]^2 / [\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4]$. First, the concentrations for each species are determined using the volume ($V = 2.00 \\text{ dm}^3$) and the formula $c = n/V$. [\\text{NO}_2] = 0.180 \\text{ mol} / 2.00 \\text{ dm}^3 = 0.0900 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$. [\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4] = 0.220 \\text{ mol} / 2.00 \\text{ dm}^3 = 0.110 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$. Finally, these concentrations are substituted into the $K_c$ expression: $K_c = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 \\approx 0.0736$. The result is reported as dimensionless as specified (L21).",
