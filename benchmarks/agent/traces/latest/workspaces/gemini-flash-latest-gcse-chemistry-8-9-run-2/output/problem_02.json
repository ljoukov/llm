  "method": "First, the actual mass of pure CaCO3 in the limestone sample is calculated using the purity percentage: 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, the moles of CaCO3 are determined using its molar mass (Mr=100.1 g mol-1) and the formula n = m/Mr: 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 \u2248 0.04196 mol. Based on the balanced chemical equation (L34), the mole ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so the moles of CO2 produced is the same as the moles of CaCO3. Finally, the mass of CO2 is calculated using its molar mass (Mr=44.0 g mol-1): 0.04196 mol * 44.0 g mol-1 \u2248 1.846 g. This is rounded to 3 significant figures.",
