  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the 5.00 g sample at 84.0% purity: 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, use the molar mass Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1 to find the moles of CaCO3: n(CaCO3) = 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 = 0.041958... mol. The reaction equation (L34) shows a 1:1 mole ratio between CaCO3 and CO2, so n(CO2) = 0.041958... mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 using Mr(CO2) = 44.0: m(CO2) = 0.041958... mol * 44.0 g mol-1 = 1.8461... g. Rounded to 3 significant figures, the mass is 1.85 g.",

    "The mass of CO2 (1.85 g) is less than the mass of pure CaCO3 (4.20 g), which is consistent with the lower molar mass of CO2 (44.0) compared to CaCO3 (100.1).",
    "The moles of CaCO3 used is approximately 4.2 / 100 = 0.042 mol, and the mass of CO2 produced is approximately 0.042 * 44 = 1.85 g, which confirms the result."
