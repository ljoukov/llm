  "method": "The enthalpy change (ΔH) is estimated using the formula ΔH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). The reaction is CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O. Bonds broken (reactants): 4 * (C-H) + 2 * (O=O). Energy to break bonds: (4 * 413) + (2 * 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed (products): 2 * (C=O) + 4 * (O-H). Energy released from forming bonds: (2 * 805) + (4 * 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. The enthalpy change is ΔH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",

    "The calculated enthalpy change is negative, indicating an exothermic reaction, which is expected for combustion.",
    "The energy released from bond formation (3462 kJ mol-1) is greater than the energy required for bond breaking (2648 kJ mol-1), confirming the negative sign for deltaH."
