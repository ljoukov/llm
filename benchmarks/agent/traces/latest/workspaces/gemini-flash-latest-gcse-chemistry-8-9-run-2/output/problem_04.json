  "method": "The enthalpy change (\\u0394H) is estimated using the formula: \\u0394H = \\u2211(bonds broken) - \\u2211(bonds formed). First, the total energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (CH4 and 2O2) is calculated. Bonds broken: 4 C-H bonds and 2 O=O bonds. Energy broken = (4 * 413) + (2 * 498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Second, the total energy released upon forming the bonds in the products (CO2 and 2H2O) is calculated. Bonds formed: 2 C=O bonds and 4 O-H bonds. Energy formed = (2 * 805) + (4 * 463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. Finally, the enthalpy change is calculated: \\u0394H = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",

    "The stoichiometry from the balanced equation (1:2:1:2) is correctly applied to the bonds.",
    "Four C-H bonds and four O-H bonds are used.",
    "The calculation results in a negative \\u0394H, as expected for a combustion reaction.",
    "The answer has 3 significant figures and the correct units (kJ mol-1)."
