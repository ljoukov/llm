  "method": "The problem asks for the new concentration (c2) of HCl after dilution. The dilution formula, c1V1 = c2V2, is used. Rearranging gives c2 = (c1V1) / V2. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. Since the units of volume cancel in the ratio, no conversion is needed. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The final answer is expressed to 3 significant figures.",

    "The dilution factor is 250.0 / 25.0 = 10. The final concentration must be the initial concentration divided by the dilution factor: 0.200 / 10 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
    "The final concentration (0.0200 mol dm-3) is lower than the initial concentration (0.200 mol dm-3), which is expected for a dilution."
