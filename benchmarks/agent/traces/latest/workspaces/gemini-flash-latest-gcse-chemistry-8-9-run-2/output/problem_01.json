  "method": "The problem involves a dilution, so the formula c1V1 = c2V2 is used. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. The final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. The final concentration (c2) is calculated by rearranging the formula to c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. The volumes are kept in cm3 as their ratio is sufficient for the calculation, and the units cancel out. The calculation is (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "V1 and V2 are in the same units (cm3), which is acceptable for the dilution equation.",
