  "method": "This is a Faraday's law calculation. First, the time is converted to seconds: $30.0 \\text{ min} \\times 60 \\text{ s/min} = 1800 \\text{ s}$. Second, the total charge (Q) passed is calculated using $Q = I \\times t$: $Q = 1.50 \\text{ A} \\times 1800 \\text{ s} = 2700 \\text{ C}$. Third, the moles of electrons ($n(e^-)$) are calculated using the Faraday constant ($F=96,500 \\text{ C mol}^{-1}$): $n(e^-) = 2700 \\text{ C} / 96500 \\text{ C mol}^{-1} \\approx 0.02798 \\text{ mol}$. Fourth, the moles of copper (Cu) deposited are found from the half-equation (L52), which has a 2:1 mole ratio of electrons to copper: $n(Cu) = 0.02798 \\text{ mol} / 2 \\approx 0.01399 \\text{ mol}$. Finally, the mass of copper is calculated using its molar mass (63.55 g mol-1): $m(\\text{Cu}) = 0.01399 \\text{ mol} \\times 63.55 \\text{ g mol}^{-1} \\approx 0.889 \\text{ g}$.",
