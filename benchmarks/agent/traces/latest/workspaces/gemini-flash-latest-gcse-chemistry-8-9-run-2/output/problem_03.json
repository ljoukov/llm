  "method": "First, calculate the moles of NaOH (nB). The volume VB = 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3. nB = cB * VB = 0.150 mol dm-3 * 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. Next, use the reaction stoichiometry (L40) which is 1:2 (H2SO4:NaOH) to find the moles of H2SO4 (nA): nA = nB / 2 = 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4 (cA). The volume VA = 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3. cA = nA / VA = 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "The required mole ratio for neutralisation is 1:2 (Acid:Base). Expected cA = cB * (VB/VA) / 2 = 0.150 * (23.40/25.00) / 2 = 0.0702 mol dm-3, confirming the calculation.",
    "The final calculated concentration (0.0702 mol dm-3) is less than the base concentration (0.150 mol dm-3), which is expected since sulfuric acid is diprotic (requires twice the base moles)."
