  "method": "First, the volumes are converted from cm3 to dm3. The moles of NaOH (n_B) are calculated using the concentration formula n = c * V: $n_{NaOH} = 0.150 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3} \\times (23.40/1000) \\text{ dm}^3 = 0.00351 \\text{ mol}$. Next, the moles of H2SO4 (n_A) are found using the stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation (L40), which is 1:2 (H2SO4:NaOH). $n_{H2SO4} = 0.00351 \\text{ mol} / 2 = 0.001755 \\text{ mol}$. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 (c_A) is calculated using $c = n/V$: $c_{H2SO4} = 0.001755 \\text{ mol} / (25.00/1000) \\text{ dm}^3 = 0.0702 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$.",
