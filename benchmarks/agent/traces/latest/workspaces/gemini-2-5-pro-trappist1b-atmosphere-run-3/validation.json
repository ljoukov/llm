Because it's so close to its star, it's likely 'tidally locked', meaning one side always faces the star, creating a permanent 'dayside' and 'nightside'. Scientists have long wondered if such a planet can hold on to an atmosphere. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a team of astronomers observed the planet's heat as it orbited its star. They found that the dayside is very hot, but not as hot as it would be if there were no atmosphere to move heat around. This suggests that some of the heat from the dayside is being carried to the nightside. The team also found a hint of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, but the evidence is not yet conclusive.

        "Public summary contains an ungrounded novelty claim: “This is the first time that a full phase curve of an Earth-sized, rocky exoplanet has been measured with JWST.” This is not supported anywhere in the provided report lines (no corresponding statement in L1–L54). Under the pass criteria, this is a fabricated factual claim.",
        "Public summary overstates evidential strength by calling heat transport “a strong indicator of an atmosphere” (in what_is_new). The report is more cautious: it says non-zero redistribution is favored (L28) and that the dataset provides evidence against a strictly airless interpretation but composition/pressure remain uncertain (L52–L53). The summary’s phrasing is more definitive than the report supports.",
        "Claim audit C04 is not well-calibrated: “The planet's atmosphere likely contains CO2” goes beyond the report’s framing. The report states the 15 µm structure is “consistent with atmospheric absorption” (L30) and discusses CO2-rich scenarios (L21–L22), but does not assert CO2 is likely; it explicitly notes degeneracies and that O2-rich cases are not ruled out (L36–L37).",
        "Claim audit C02 assigns strength = “strong” to a claim that is essentially interpretive/qualitative (“dayside is warm, but this alone does not prove a bare surface”). While consistent with L27, the report does not present this as a high-certainty/standalone strong conclusion; it is part of a broader, caveated interpretation (L52–L53).",
        "Study overview omits a key scenario listed in the report: the O2-rich atmosphere scenario (L22–L23, L36). This reduces downstream usefulness for reviewers trying to track all modeled alternatives mentioned in the report."

The limitations lists in study_overview.json align well with the report caveats (L46–L51). However, the overall output set fails strict grading because the public_summary.json introduces an unsupported “first time with JWST” claim (not in the report) and uses stronger language than the report about atmospheric inference. Additionally, claim_audit.json over-cal"
