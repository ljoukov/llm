  "headline": "JWST Finds Evidence for an Atmosphere on Earth-sized Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 b",
  "plain_language_summary": "Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have found signs that TRAPPIST-1 b, a rocky planet roughly the size of Earth, might have an atmosphere. By observing how the planet's heat changes as it orbits its star, researchers found that the temperature differences between its day and night sides are smaller than expected for a bare rock. This suggests that heat is being moved around by an atmosphere. Additionally, they detected a possible spectral signal from carbon dioxide. While the findings are not definitive, they represent a significant step in understanding whether planets orbiting small, cool stars can hold onto their atmospheres.",

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "The atmospheric composition and pressure are still highly uncertain.",
    "Instrument noise and star activity could potentially mimic the observed signals.",
    "Constraints on the planet's night-side temperature are still relatively weak."
