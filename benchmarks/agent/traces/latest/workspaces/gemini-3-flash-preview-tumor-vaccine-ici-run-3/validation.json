Researchers found that injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors in mice caused an inflammatory response that made the cancer cells easier for the immune system to find and kill. This 'sensitization' effect was also seen in a group of human patients: those who had previously received a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine lived longer while on ICI therapy than those who hadn't.
