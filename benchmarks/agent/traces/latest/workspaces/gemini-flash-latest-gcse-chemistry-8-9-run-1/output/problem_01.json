  "method": "The dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2 is used to find the final concentration (c2). We rearrange the formula to c2 = (c1V1) / V2. Using the given values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3. The volumes are in the same unit (cm3) so conversion to dm3 is not necessary for the ratio. c2 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "The dilution factor is V2/V1 = 250.0 cm3 / 25.0 cm3 = 10.0.",

    "The final concentration (0.0200) is less than the initial concentration (0.200), as expected for a dilution."
