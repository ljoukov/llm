  "method": "The final concentration (c2) is determined using the dilution equation, c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 is the initial concentration, V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume. The volumes can be used in cm3 as they cancel out. The final concentration is calculated as c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "The dilution factor is 250.0 cm3 / 25.0 cm3 = 10.",
    "The initial concentration (0.200 mol dm-3) divided by the dilution factor (10) gives 0.0200 mol dm-3, confirming the calculation.",
    "The final concentration (0.0200 mol dm-3) is correctly lower than the initial concentration, as expected for a dilution."
