  "method": "The dilution formula, $c_1V_1 = c_2V_2$, is used to find the final concentration ($c_2$). The initial concentration ($c_1$) is $0.200 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$, the initial volume ($V_1$) is $25.0 \\text{ cm}^3$, and the final volume ($V_2$) is $250.0 \\text{ cm}^3$. Since the ratio of volumes is used, it is not necessary to convert to $\\text{dm}^3$ as long as the units are consistent. The equation is rearranged to $c_2 = c_1 \\times (V_1 / V_2)$. The calculation is $c_2 = 0.200 \\times (25.0 / 250.0) = 0.0200 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$.",

    "The final volume (250.0 cm3) is exactly 10 times the initial volume (25.0 cm3). Therefore, the final concentration should be one-tenth of the initial concentration. 0.200 mol dm-3 / 10 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. This confirms the calculation."
