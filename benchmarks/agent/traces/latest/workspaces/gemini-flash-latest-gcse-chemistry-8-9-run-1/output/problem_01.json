  "method": "The problem requires calculating the final concentration of an HCl solution after dilution. This is a direct application of the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2. The initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3, the initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3, and the final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. The volumes are in the same units (cm3), so no conversion is necessary for the ratio. The final concentration (c2) is calculated as (c1 * V1) / V2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3.",

    "The volume increases by a factor of 250.0 / 25.0 = 10.",
    "The concentration must decrease by the same factor: 0.200 / 10 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The calculation is correct."
