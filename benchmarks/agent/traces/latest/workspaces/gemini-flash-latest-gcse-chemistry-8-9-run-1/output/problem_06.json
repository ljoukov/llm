  "method": "The equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g) is calculated using the expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. First, calculate the concentration (c = n/V) for each species using the volume V = 2.00 dm3. [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Next, substitute the concentrations into the Kc expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 ≈ 0.073636. As Kc is reported as dimensionless, the final answer rounded to three significant figures is 0.0736.",
