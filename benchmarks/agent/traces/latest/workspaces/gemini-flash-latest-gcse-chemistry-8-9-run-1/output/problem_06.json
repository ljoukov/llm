  "method": "To calculate the equilibrium constant $K_c$, the concentrations of the reactants and products must first be determined. Concentration is calculated using $c = n / V$. The volume of the vessel is $V = 2.00 \\text{ dm}^3$. $[\\text{NO}_2] = 0.180 \\text{ mol} / 2.00 \\text{ dm}^3 = 0.0900 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$. $[\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4] = 0.220 \\text{ mol} / 2.00 \\text{ dm}^3 = 0.110 \\text{ mol dm}^{-3}$. The $K_c$ expression for $\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4(\\text{g}) \\leftrightharpoons 2\\text{NO}_2(\\text{g})$ is $K_c = [\\text{NO}_2]^2 / [\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4]$. Substituting the concentrations: $K_c = (0.0900)^2 / (0.110) = 0.00810 / 0.110 \\approx 0.073636$. The result is reported to three significant figures as $0.0736$. The constant is dimensionless as per the instructions.",

    "Since the concentration of the reactant ([N2O4] = 0.110 mol dm-3) is higher than the concentration of the product ([NO2] = 0.0900 mol dm-3), and the exponent is 2 for the product, it is expected that Kc will be less than 1. (0.0900)^2 = 0.00810. 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. This is consistent with expectations."
