  "method": "First, the concentrations of the species are calculated using c = n/V (L15). [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 (L57, L56). [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3 (L58, L56). Next, the Kc expression is used: Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] (L20). Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 ≈ 0.073636. Rounded to three significant figures, Kc = 0.0736.",

  "checks": [
    "Concentrations are [NO2] = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.110 mol dm-3.",
    "Kc = (0.0900 * 0.0900) / 0.110 = 0.073636.",
    "The reaction has a smaller forward equilibrium constant (Kc < 1), indicating that the equilibrium lies to the left, which is consistent with the higher concentration of the reactant N2O4 (0.110) than the product NO2 (0.0900)."
