    "precision_note": "All mean bond energy values are given to three significant figures, so the final estimated enthalpy change is reported to three significant figures."
  },
  "method": "The enthalpy change ($\u0394$H) is estimated using the formula: \u0394H = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). Bonds broken (reactants): 4 (C-H) + 2 (O=O) = 4(413) + 2(498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed (products): 2 (C=O) + 4 (O-H) = 2(805) + 4(463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. The estimated enthalpy change is \u0394H = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
