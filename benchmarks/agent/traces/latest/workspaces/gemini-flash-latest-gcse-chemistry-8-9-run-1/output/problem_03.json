  "method": "First, calculate the moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = c * V. V must be converted to dm3: n(NaOH) = 0.150 mol dm-3 * (23.40 / 1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol (L15, L39). The balanced equation (L40) H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> ... shows a 1:2 mole ratio. Thus, the moles of H2SO4 is half the moles of NaOH: n(H2SO4) = 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4: c = n / V. V must be converted to dm3: c(H2SO4) = 0.001755 mol / (25.00 / 1000) dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "The acid volume (25.00 cm3) is slightly larger than the base volume (23.40 cm3), but the acid is diprotic (2:1 ratio), so the acid concentration is expected to be less than half of the base concentration (0.075), which 0.0702 is."
