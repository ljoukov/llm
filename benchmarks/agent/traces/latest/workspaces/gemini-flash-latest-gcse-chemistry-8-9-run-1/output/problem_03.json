  "method": "The concentration of H2SO4 is determined using titration data and stoichiometry. First, calculate the moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = c * V. V(NaOH) is 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3. n(NaOH) = 0.150 mol dm-3 * 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. The balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O shows a 1:2 molar ratio (Acid:Base). Therefore, moles of H2SO4 = n(NaOH) / 2 = 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4: c(H2SO4) = n / V. V(H2SO4) is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3. c(H2SO4) = 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
