  "method": "The maximum mass of CO2 produced is calculated based on the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample. First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3: 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, calculate the moles of CaCO3: n(CaCO3) = m/Mr = 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 ≈ 0.041958 mol. According to the reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so moles of CO2 produced is also 0.041958 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2: m(CO2) = n * Mr = 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g mol-1 ≈ 1.84615 g. Rounded to three significant figures, the mass is 1.85 g.",
