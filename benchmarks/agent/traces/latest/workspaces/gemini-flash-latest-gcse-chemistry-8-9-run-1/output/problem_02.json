    "precision_note": "The limestone sample mass (5.00 g) and the percentage purity (84.0%) both have three significant figures, which limits the final answer to three significant figures. Mr(CO2) = 44.0 also has three significant figures, while Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1 has four."
  },
  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure $\\text{CaCO}_3$ in the sample by applying the purity percentage: $\\text{Mass}(\\text{CaCO}_3) = 5.00 \\text{ g} \\times 0.840 = 4.20 \\text{ g}$. Second, use the relative formula mass $\\text{Mr}(\\text{CaCO}_3) = 100.1 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$ to find the moles of $\\text{CaCO}_3$: $n(\\text{CaCO}_3) = 4.20 \\text{ g} / 100.1 \\text{ g mol}^{-1} \\approx 0.041958 \\text{ mol}$. Third, using the $1:1$ mole ratio from the balanced equation $\\text{CaCO}_3 + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{CaCl}_2 + \\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, the moles of $\\text{CO}_2$ produced is also $0.041958 \\text{ mol}$. Finally, convert moles of $\\text{CO}_2$ to mass using $\\text{Mr}(\\text{CO}_2) = 44.0 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$: $\\text{Mass}(\\text{CO}_2) = 0.041958 \\text{ mol} \\times 44.0 \\text{ g mol}^{-1} \\approx 1.846 \\text{ g}$. Rounded to three significant figures, the maximum mass of $\\text{CO}_2$ is $1.85 \\text{ g}$.",

    "The mass of CO2 produced can be verified by the mass fraction calculation: Mass(CO2) = Mass(sample) * Purity * (Mr(CO2) / Mr(CaCO3)). Mass(CO2) = 5.00 * 0.840 * (44.0 / 100.1) = 1.846 g. This confirms the multi-step calculation."
