I'm now focused on incorporating the required fields: `problem_id`, a structured `final_answer` object, and a detailed `method` description. I'm working to adapt my approach to fit this revised framework.\n\n\n**Defining the Fields**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy understanding of the required fields is solid now. I've populated the structure for P01, and the `final_answer` object, the method description, equations used, line references, and checks are all in place. I have confirmed that I need to capture precision details as well. I'm now testing the structure's flexibility as I work through the next problem.\n\n\n**Structuring the Output**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy primary focus is on how to integrate the calculations into the required structure efficiently.  I've finished the initial problem, P01. Now, I'm working through P02, carefully adapting the output of each calculation to fit the structure, including the `final_answer` object, method details, and supporting data. I've noted that for P02 I must calculate the mass of pure $CaCO_3$ as the first step.\n\n\n**Processing the Data**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI'm now fully immersed in problem P02. I've calculated the mass of $CaCO_3$, the number of moles, and then the mass of $CO_2$. I've also integrated the relevant data and references, and now I'm making sure that I have included the correct significant figures, as instructed, before finalizing the answer.\n\n\n**Calculating and Formatting**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI'm now integrating the calculations from P01 and P02 into the required structure, including `problem_id`, the `final_answer` object, and a detailed `method` section. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy, including proper units and significant figures.  For the `checks` section, I'm providing an additional calculation that may or may not agree exactly due to rounding. I will complete P03 next.\n\n\n**Calculating Results**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've completed the detailed calculations and structural integration for all problems, P01 through P03.  I've verified the accuracy of the `final_answer` and the `method` descriptions, including the proper use of units and significant figures. The checks seem consistent. I'm now setting up the remaining structure for problem P04, focusing on the bond energy estimation.\n\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current effort involves extracting data and equations for P04, preparing to calculate the enthalpy change using bond energies. The steps are clearly defined and the formula has been provided for this.  I'm now focusing on the calculation steps for the sum of broken and formed bonds. I'm keeping precision in mind, and also checking for any potential issues with SF.\n\n\n**Integrating Answers**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've completed the structural integration of the answers for all provided problems (P01-P04).  I've ensured accuracy in each `final_answer`, method descriptions, and included all supporting data, units, and the requested significant figures. I have added sanity checks to each problem to confirm validity. Now I am working on the remaining problem, P05, which involves electrolysis.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Answers**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current focus is on compiling each problem's data into the required format. I'm organizing the `final_answer`, method descriptions, key equations, and all the supporting data, ensuring that all the answers have correct units and adhere to the given significant figures rules. Next, I will populate the data for the final problem, P05.\n\n\n**Synthesizing and Populating Data**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI'm currently finalizing the data and calculations for P05, completing the required structural format. I'm focusing on meticulous checks to ensure accuracy in the calculations and formatting, paying close attention to significant figures and units. Then, I will move on to assembling the information from P06, and finally combine all of the problem solutions into the output file.\n\n\n**Compiling and Formatting**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've completed all calculations, confirmations, and structural integrations for problems P01-P06. I have also added sanity checks for each problem and confirmed that the significant figures and units are correct. I am now creating the final combined JSON output for the expert user.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Compilation**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current efforts involve compiling the solutions, which I have completed, for problems P01-P06 into JSON format, ensuring that each has all of the required fields. I have checked for accuracy and proper formatting of all output, and ensured that all required significant figures have been included for all calculated values. The output file has now been generated.\n\n\n**Completing the Format**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've completed the JSON formatting for problems P01 and P02, and the preliminary drafts are satisfactory. I've populated all fields, including `final_answer`, method descriptions, relevant equations, line references, and sanity checks. I am now working through the remaining problems (P03, P04, P05, and P06) and generating the output.\n\n\n**Finalizing JSONs**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've reviewed and finalized the JSON structures for all six problems (P01-P06). I've ensured all required fields are populated, including the `problem_id`, `final_answer`, `method`, `key_equations`, `line_refs`, and `checks` sections. Each `final_answer` object contains the `value`, `units`, and `precision_note`. The output file is now ready for submission.\n\n\n**Compiling JSONs**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've completed the JSON formatting for problems P03 and P04, following the structure established in the drafts for P01 and P02. I've populated all fields, including the `final_answer`, method descriptions, relevant equations, line references, and sanity checks. Now I will complete the JSON structures for problems P05 and P06.\n\n\n**Formatting the Output**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've completed the JSON formatting for problems P03 and P04, following the structure established in the drafts for P01 and P02, including all required fields. I have also added comprehensive checks to confirm the validity of the final answers. Now, my focus is to finish the final two problems, P05 and P06, and compile them into the output file.\n\n\n**Formatting the JSON Output**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've completed the JSON formatting for problems P05 and P06. I've populated all fields, including the `final_answer`, method descriptions, relevant equations, line references, and sanity checks. I have also confirmed the format, and the presence and validity of the data. I've performed final checks for all problems, P01 to P06, and have confirmed that the combined output file is valid.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Answers for Output**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current focus is on compiling the JSON formatted outputs for problems P05 and P06, including all required fields.
