  "method": "First, calculate the number of moles of NaOH used: n = c * V = 0.150 mol dm-3 * 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. The balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O shows a 1:2 molar ratio between H2SO4 and NaOH. Thus, the moles of H2SO4 are 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. The concentration of H2SO4 is then calculated using c = n / V = 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3. Volumes were converted from cm3 to dm3 by dividing by 1000.",
