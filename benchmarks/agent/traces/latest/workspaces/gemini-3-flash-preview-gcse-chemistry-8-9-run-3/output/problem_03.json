  "method": "First, calculate the number of moles of NaOH used in the titration using the formula n = c * V. The volume must be converted from cm3 to dm3 (23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3). So, n(NaOH) = 0.150 mol dm-3 * 0.02340 dm3 = 0.00351 mol. According to the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the molar ratio of H2SO4 to NaOH is 1:2. Therefore, the moles of H2SO4 = 0.00351 mol / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate the concentration of H2SO4 using c = n / V with the volume of H2SO4 (25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3). So, c(H2SO4) = 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
