  "method": "First, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the two gases by dividing the number of moles by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3). Concentration of NO2 = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. Concentration of N2O4 = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Then, use the equilibrium constant expression Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] provided in the formula reminders. Substitute the concentrations into the expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110. Kc = 0.0081 / 0.110 = 0.073636. The final value for Kc, reported as dimensionless as instructed, is 0.0736 when rounded to three significant figures.",
