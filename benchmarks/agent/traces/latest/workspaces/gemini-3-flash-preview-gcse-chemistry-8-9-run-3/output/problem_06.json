  "method": "Calculate equilibrium concentrations by dividing the number of moles by the volume (2.00 dm3). [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. The equilibrium constant expression for N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g) is Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Substituting the concentrations: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.0081 / 0.110 \u2248 0.073636. As per instructions, Kc is reported as dimensionless, so the final value is 0.0736.",
