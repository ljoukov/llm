  "method": "DeltaH is calculated using the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). Bonds broken: 4 C-H bonds (4 * 413 = 1652 kJ/mol) and 2 O=O bonds (2 * 498 = 996 kJ/mol), totaling 2648 kJ/mol. Bonds formed: 2 C=O bonds in CO2 (2 * 805 = 1610 kJ/mol) and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O (4 * 463 = 1852 kJ/mol), totaling 3462 kJ/mol. Subtracting the bonds formed from the bonds broken: deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative sign indicates an exothermic reaction.",
