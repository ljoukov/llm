  "method": "Determine the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and the energy released when bonds are formed in the products using the formula deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). Reactants: 1 mole of CH4 contains 4 moles of C-H bonds (4 * 413 = 1652 kJ) and 2 moles of O2 contain 2 moles of O=O bonds (2 * 498 = 996 kJ). Total energy to break bonds = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ. Products: 1 mole of CO2 contains 2 moles of C=O bonds (2 * 805 = 1610 kJ) and 2 moles of H2O contain 4 moles of O-H bonds (4 * 463 = 1852 kJ). Total energy released by forming bonds = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ. Net enthalpy change deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ/mol.",
