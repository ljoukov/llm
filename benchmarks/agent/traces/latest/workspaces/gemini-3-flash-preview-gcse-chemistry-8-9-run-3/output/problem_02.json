  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the sample: 5.00 g * 84.0% = 4.20 g. Next, convert this mass to moles using the formula n = m / Mr with Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1: n = 4.20 / 100.1 \u2248 0.041958 mol. According to the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so 0.041958 mol of CO2 is produced. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 using m = n * Mr with Mr(CO2) = 44.0: m = 0.041958 * 44.0 \u2248 1.84615 g. This rounds to 1.85 g.",
