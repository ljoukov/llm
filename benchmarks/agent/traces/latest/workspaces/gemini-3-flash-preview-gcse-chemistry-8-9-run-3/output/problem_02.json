  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure calcium carbonate in the limestone sample by multiplying the total mass (5.00 g) by the purity percentage (84.0%), which gives 4.20 g of CaCO3. Next, calculate the number of moles of CaCO3 using the formula n = m / Mr, with the molar mass of CaCO3 being 100.1 g/mol (4.20 g / 100.1 g/mol = 0.04196 mol). From the balanced chemical equation, the molar ratio of CaCO3 to CO2 is 1:1, so 0.04196 mol of CO2 is produced. Finally, calculate the mass of CO2 by multiplying its moles by its molar mass (44.0 g/mol), resulting in 1.84615 g, which rounds to 1.85 g to three significant figures.",
