  "method": "Start with the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2 from the constant list. Initial concentration (c1) is 0.200 mol dm-3 and initial volume (V1) is 25.0 cm3. Final volume (V2) is 250.0 cm3. Rearrange the formula to solve for final concentration (c2): c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substitute values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 * 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The final concentration of HCl is 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
