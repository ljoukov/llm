  "method": "To find the new concentration of HCl after dilution, the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2 is applied. The initial concentration c1 is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume V1 is 25.0 cm3. The final volume V2 is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging the formula to solve for the final concentration c2 gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The units of cm3 cancel out during the calculation.",
