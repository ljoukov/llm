  "method": "Calculate the total charge (Q) passed through the cell using Q = I * t, where I = 1.50 A and t = 30.0 minutes (30.0 * 60 = 1800 seconds). Q = 1.50 * 1800 = 2700 C. Next, find the moles of electrons using n(e-) = Q / F, where F = 96,500 C mol-1. n(e-) = 2700 / 96500 = 0.02798 mol. The half-equation Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu shows that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. Moles of Cu = 0.02798 / 2 = 0.01399 mol. Finally, calculate the mass of copper deposited using m = n * Mr, where Mr(Cu) = 63.55 g/mol. Mass = 0.01399 * 63.55 = 0.889 g.",
