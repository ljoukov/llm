  "method": "The equilibrium constant Kc is defined as Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. First calculate the concentrations of each species using c = n / V where V = 2.00 dm3 (given). Thus [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm‑3 and [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm‑3. Substitute these values into the Kc expression: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. The calculation is limited by the three‑significant‑figure data, so the result is reported to three significant figures as 0.0736 (unitless).",
