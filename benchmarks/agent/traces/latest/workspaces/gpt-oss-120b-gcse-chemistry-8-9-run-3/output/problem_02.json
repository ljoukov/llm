  "method": "The mass of CaCO3 in the limestone is obtained by multiplying the total sample mass by the percentage purity (5.00 g × 84.0% = 4.20 g). The amount of substance is then calculated using the molar mass of CaCO3 (100.1 g·mol‑1) via n = m/Mr, giving n = 4.20 g / 100.1 g·mol‑1 = 0.0419 mol. The reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O shows a 1:1 stoichiometry between CaCO3 and CO2, so the same amount of CO2 moles is produced. Multiplying by the molar mass of CO2 (44.0 g·mol‑1) yields the mass of CO2 = 0.0419 mol × 44.0 g·mol‑1 = 1.85 g, reported to three significant figures.",
