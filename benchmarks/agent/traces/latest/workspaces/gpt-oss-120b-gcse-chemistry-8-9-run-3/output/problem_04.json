  "method": "The combustion reaction CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O is analysed using bond energies. Bonds broken: four C–H bonds (4 × 413 kJ mol‑1) and two O=O bonds (2 × 498 kJ mol‑1) giving a total of 2 648 kJ mol‑1. Bonds formed: two C=O bonds in CO2 (2 × 805 kJ mol‑1) and four O–H bonds in the two H2O molecules (4 × 463 kJ mol‑1) totalling 3 462 kJ mol‑1. The enthalpy change ΔH is the energy of bonds broken minus the energy of bonds formed: ΔH = 2 648 – 3 462 = –814 kJ mol‑1. Significant figures are dictated by the given bond energies (three‑figure values), so the answer is reported as –814 kJ mol‑1.",
