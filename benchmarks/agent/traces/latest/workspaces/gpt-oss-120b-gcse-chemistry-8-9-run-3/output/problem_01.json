  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 is the initial concentration (0.200 mol dm‑3), V1 the initial volume (25.0 cm3 = 0.0250 dm3) and V2 the final volume (250.0 cm3 = 0.250 dm3). Solving for c2 gives c2 = c1V1/V2 = 0.200 × 0.0250 / 0.250 = 0.0200 mol dm‑3. Significant figures are dictated by the data (3 sf), so the answer is reported as 0.0200 mol dm‑3.",
