  "headline": "Intratumoral mRNA Vaccines May Boost Cancer Immunotherapy",
  "plain_language_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are drugs that help the immune system fight cancer, but they don't work for everyone. This study explored whether injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors could make them more responsive to ICIs. In mice, the vaccine triggered an 'alarm' system (type I interferon) that made tumor cells show more of their proteins to the immune system. This helped immune cells recognize and attack the tumor when combined with ICI therapy. The researchers also looked at past data from human patients and found that those who had received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines seemed to respond better to ICI treatment. While promising, this research is still in early stages. The human data is based on looking back at past records, which can be less reliable than controlled trials. Future studies are needed to confirm if this strategy is safe and effective for cancer patients.",
