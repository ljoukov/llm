The text moves from “injecting an mRNA vaccine directly into tumors” to “those who had received SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA vaccines seemed to respond better” without explicitly stating these are different interventions/settings, which can mislead downstream users about what was actually tested clinically (L15, L30, L49-L52).",

Given the task’s emphasis on calibrated claims, omission of these explicit caveats weakens practical interpretability.",
        "Some ‘quote’ fields in `claim_audit.json` are not actual quotes from the report lines but paraphrased table interpretations (e.g., “Marked induction after mRNA vaccination in tumors” tied to L31; “Broader antigen display…” tied to L28). While the line refs point to relevant lines, presenting paraphrases as quotes reduces auditability and can be problematic for strict downstream review requiring verbatim support.",
        "Evidence attribution is occasionally padded with non-specific or non-supporting lines: for example, C05 (“Lipid nanoparticles alone are insufficient for sensitization”) is supported by L38, but also cites L42 which does not address lipid-only controls. This is not a direct contradiction, but it weakens evidentiary precision expected in a strict scientific claim audit."
