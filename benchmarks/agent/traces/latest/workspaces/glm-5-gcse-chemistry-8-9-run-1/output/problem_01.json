  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, the initial concentration (0.200 mol dm-3) and initial volume (25.0 cm3) are used to find the new concentration after dilution to 250.0 cm3. Rearranging: c2 = c1V1/V2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 × 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The dilution factor is 10-fold, so concentration decreases by factor of 10.",
