  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, the initial concentration of HCl is 0.200 mol dm-3 and the initial volume is 25.0 cm3. After dilution to a final volume of 250.0 cm3, the new concentration is calculated as c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration decreases by a factor of 10, which matches the dilution factor.",

    "The dilution factor is 250.0/25.0 = 10, so concentration should decrease by factor of 10 from 0.200 to 0.0200 mol dm-3."
