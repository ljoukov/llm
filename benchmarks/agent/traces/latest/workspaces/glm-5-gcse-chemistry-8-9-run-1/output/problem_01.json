    "precision_note": "Answer given to 3 significant figures, consistent with the precision of the initial concentration (0.200 mol dm-3) and volumes (25.0 cm3, 250.0 cm3)."
  },
  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 is the initial concentration, V1 = 25.0 cm3 is the initial volume, and V2 = 250.0 cm3 is the final volume. Rearranging gives c2 = c1V1/V2. Substituting values: c2 = (0.200 × 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration decreases by a factor of 10, consistent with a tenfold volume increase.",

  "checks": [
    "Dilution factor is 250.0/25.0 = 10, so concentration should decrease tenfold from 0.200 to 0.0200 mol dm-3.",
    "Units consistent: mol dm-3 throughout the calculation.",
    "Three significant figures maintained throughout as per GCSE conventions."
