  "method": "Using the dilution equation c1V1 = c2V2, where c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 is the initial concentration, V1 = 25.0 cm3 is the initial volume, and V2 = 250.0 cm3 is the final volume. Rearranging gives c2 = (c1 × V1) / V2. Substituting values: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 × 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration decreases by a factor of 10, matching the 10-fold volume increase from 25.0 cm3 to 250.0 cm3.",
