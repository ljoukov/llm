  "method": "First calculate equilibrium concentrations by dividing moles by volume: [NO2] = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.090 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Then apply the equilibrium expression for N2O4(g) <-> 2NO2(g): Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4] = (0.090)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. Kc is reported as dimensionless as specified in the report.",
