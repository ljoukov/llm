  "method": "Using deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). For CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O: Bonds broken are 4 C-H bonds (4 × 413 = 1652 kJ mol-1) and 2 O=O bonds (2 × 498 = 996 kJ mol-1), total = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed are 2 C=O bonds in CO2 (2 × 805 = 1610 kJ mol-1) and 4 O-H bonds in 2H2O (4 × 463 = 1852 kJ mol-1), total = 3462 kJ mol-1. Therefore deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1. The negative value indicates an exothermic reaction.",

    "Bond count verification: CH4 has 4 C-H bonds; 2O2 has 2 O=O bonds; CO2 has 2 C=O bonds; 2H2O has 4 O-H bonds. All correct.",
    "Sign check: More energy released from bond formation than required for bond breaking, so negative deltaH is correct for exothermic combustion."
