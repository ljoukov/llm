  "method": "Using deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). For bonds broken in reactants: CH4 has 4 C-H bonds = 4 × 413 = 1652 kJ mol-1; 2O2 has 2 O=O bonds = 2 × 498 = 996 kJ mol-1. Total bonds broken = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. For bonds formed in products: CO2 has 2 C=O bonds = 2 × 805 = 1610 kJ mol-1; 2H2O has 4 O-H bonds = 4 × 463 = 1852 kJ mol-1. Total bonds formed = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
