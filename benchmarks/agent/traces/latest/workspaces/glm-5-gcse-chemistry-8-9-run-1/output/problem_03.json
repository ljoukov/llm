  "method": "First, calculate moles of NaOH used: n(NaOH) = c × V = 0.150 mol dm-3 × (23.40/1000) dm3 = 0.00351 mol. From the balanced equation (L40), 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of H2SO4, so n(H2SO4) = 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, calculate concentration of H2SO4: c = n/V = 0.001755 mol / (25.00/1000) dm3 = 0.001755 / 0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
