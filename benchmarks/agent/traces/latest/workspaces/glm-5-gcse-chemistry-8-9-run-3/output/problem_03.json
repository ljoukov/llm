  "method": "First, convert volumes to dm3: V(NaOH) = 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3. Calculate moles of NaOH using c = n/V rearranged as n = cV: n(NaOH) = 0.150 mol dm-3 × 0.02340 dm3 = 0.003510 mol. From the balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O, the mole ratio NaOH:H2SO4 is 2:1. Therefore, n(H2SO4) = 0.003510 / 2 = 0.001755 mol. Finally, concentration of H2SO4 = n/V = 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",
