  "method": "This is a dilution problem. The technician transfers 25.0 cm3 of 0.200 mol dm-3 HCl and dilutes to a final volume of 250.0 cm3. Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, we rearrange to find c2 = (c1V1)/V2. Substituting: c2 = (0.200 mol dm-3 × 25.0 cm3) / 250.0 cm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration decreases by a factor of 10, consistent with a tenfold volume increase.",

    "Dilution factor is 250.0/25.0 = 10, so concentration should be 1/10 of original = 0.0200 mol dm-3",
