  "method": "Using the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2, the initial concentration is 0.200 mol dm-3 and initial volume is 25.0 cm3. The final volume after dilution is 250.0 cm3. Rearranging the formula: c2 = (c1 x V1) / V2 = (0.200 x 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.00 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The concentration decreases by a factor of 10, consistent with the 10-fold volume increase from 25.0 cm3 to 250.0 cm3.",
