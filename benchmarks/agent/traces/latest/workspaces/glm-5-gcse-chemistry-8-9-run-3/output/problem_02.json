  "method": "First, calculate the mass of pure CaCO3 in the limestone sample: mass = 5.00 g × 0.840 = 4.20 g. Next, calculate moles of CaCO3 using n = m/Mr: n(CaCO3) = 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 = 0.04196 mol. From the balanced equation CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O, the mole ratio is 1:1 for CaCO3:CO2. Therefore, moles of CO2 = 0.04196 mol. Finally, mass of CO2 = n × Mr = 0.04196 mol × 44.0 g mol-1 = 1.846 g ≈ 1.85 g.",

    "Mass of pure CaCO3 = 5.00 × 0.840 = 4.20 g, which is less than sample mass",

    "Final mass of CO2 (1.85 g) is less than mass of CaCO3 (4.20 g), as expected since Mr(CO2) < Mr(CaCO3)"
