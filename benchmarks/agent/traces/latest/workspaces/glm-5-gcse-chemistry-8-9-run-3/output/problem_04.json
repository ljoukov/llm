  "method": "Bonds broken (endothermic, positive): CH4 has 4 C-H bonds = 4 × 413 = 1652 kJ mol-1. 2O2 molecules have 2 O=O bonds = 2 × 498 = 996 kJ mol-1. Total bonds broken = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed (exothermic, negative): CO2 has 2 C=O bonds = 2 × 805 = 1610 kJ mol-1. 2H2O molecules have 4 O-H bonds = 4 × 463 = 1852 kJ mol-1. Total bonds formed = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. Using deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed) = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
