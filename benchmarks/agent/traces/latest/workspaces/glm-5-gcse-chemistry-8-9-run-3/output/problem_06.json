  "method": "First, calculate equilibrium concentrations in the 2.00 dm3 vessel. [NO2] = moles/volume = 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3. [N2O4] = moles/volume = 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3. Using the equilibrium expression for N2O4(g) ↔ 2NO2(g): Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4]. Substituting: Kc = (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.0736. Kc is reported as dimensionless as specified in the report.",

    "Kc < 1 indicates equilibrium lies to the left (towards N2O4), consistent with higher moles of N2O4 (0.220 mol) than NO2 (0.180 mol)",
    "Concentration units (mol dm-3) cancel in the Kc expression, giving a dimensionless value",
    "The stoichiometry shows 2 moles of NO2 for every 1 mole of N2O4 at equilibrium"
