This study tested a new strategy: using an mRNA vaccine, similar to those for COVID-19, delivered directly into a tumor to make it more vulnerable. In mouse models, injecting the mRNA vaccine into the tumor triggered a strong local immune response, specifically a marked induction of a type I interferon signal (normalized score of 3.1 vs 1.0). This signal acts like a flare, causing the tumor to display a significantly wider array of its internal proteins on its surface, increasing the fraction of tumor proteins represented in the immunopeptidome from 37.3% to 62.3%. This expansion of the antigen presentation landscape makes the tumor much more \\\"visible\\\" to the body's T cells. This treatment also increased the checkpoint molecule PD-L1 by 2.4-fold, which rationalizes the use of checkpoint inhibitor drugs (anti-PD-L1). The combination therapy resulted in increased CD8+ T-cell density and improved tumor control in mice. Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of 130 human metastatic cancer patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors suggested that those who had previously received a standard SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine had improved survival (p=0.01), cautiously suggesting the mechanism might be clinically relevant.
