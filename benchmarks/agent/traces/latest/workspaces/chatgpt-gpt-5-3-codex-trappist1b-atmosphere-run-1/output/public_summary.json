  "headline": "JWST phase-curve data suggest TRAPPIST-1 b may have an atmosphere, but key details remain uncertain",
  "plain_language_summary": "Scientists used JWST to watch heat from TRAPPIST-1 b over its orbit and to look for spectral structure near a CO2-sensitive wavelength. When they combined these measurements, atmosphere-bearing models explained the data better than a strictly airless model. The results also favored some day-night heat transport instead of the most extreme bare-rock reradiation case. However, important alternatives remain: the report states that a pure no-atmosphere model cannot match all observed behaviors at once, but it also states that O2-rich atmosphere cases are not fully ruled out and that strong degeneracies remain among composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation assumptions. So this is meaningful evidence against a strictly airless interpretation, not final proof of a specific atmospheric makeup.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The analysis jointly used thermal phase variation and spectral structure, giving stronger constraints than either observable alone.",
    "A non-zero heat redistribution parameter was favored relative to the strict no-atmosphere reradiation limit.",
    "A CO2-band-region spectral depth estimate was reported and interpreted as consistent with atmospheric absorption."
  ],
  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "A single-planet result cannot establish how common atmospheres are across rocky planets around M dwarfs.",
    "O2-rich atmosphere scenarios are still compatible with current data, so composition is not uniquely identified.",
    "Degeneracies among composition, clouds/hazes, and circulation assumptions remain significant in retrievals.",
    "Stellar variability and instrument systematics can bias weak spectral signatures.",
    "Night-side constraints are currently weaker than day-side constraints."
