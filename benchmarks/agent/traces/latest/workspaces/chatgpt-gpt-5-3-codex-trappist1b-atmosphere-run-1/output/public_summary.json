  "headline": "JWST phase-curve data suggest TRAPPIST-1 b is likely not completely airless",
  "plain_language_summary": "Scientists used the James Webb Space Telescope to watch heat coming from TRAPPIST-1 b over its orbit and to look for telltale patterns in its infrared spectrum. If the planet were a bare rock with no atmosphere, its day side and night side heat pattern and spectrum should follow a simpler signature. Instead, the data are better matched by models that include some atmospheric heat transport and an absorption feature near 15 microns that is consistent with carbon-dioxide-rich possibilities. Even so, this is not a final detection of a specific atmosphere type. Different assumptions about circulation, clouds, and composition can still mimic parts of the signal, and some alternative atmospheres are not ruled out. The result is best viewed as meaningful evidence against a strictly airless planet, with follow-up observations needed to determine what the atmosphere is made of and how thick it is.",
  "what_is_new": [
    "The study combines thermal phase-curve behavior and spectral structure in one joint atmospheric test.",
    "A non-zero heat redistribution estimate is retrieved instead of the strict no-atmosphere limit.",
    "A 15 um spectral feature and likelihood-ratio comparison together favor atmosphere-bearing models."

  "why_caution_is_needed": [
    "This is evidence from one planet, so it does not show how common atmospheres are on all rocky M-dwarf worlds.",
    "Model assumptions about clouds, chemistry, and circulation can shift inferred composition and pressure.",
    "Weak spectral features can be biased by stellar variability or instrument systematics.",
    "Current night-side constraints are weaker than day-side constraints, limiting full climate interpretation."
