  "method": "Use deltaH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed). In CH4 + 2O2, bonds broken are 4(C-H) and 2(O=O): 4(413) + 2(498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ mol-1. Bonds formed in CO2 + 2H2O are 2(C=O in CO2) and 4(O-H): 2(805) + 4(463) = 1610 + 1852 = 3462 kJ mol-1. Therefore deltaH = 2648 - 3462 = -814 kJ mol-1.",
