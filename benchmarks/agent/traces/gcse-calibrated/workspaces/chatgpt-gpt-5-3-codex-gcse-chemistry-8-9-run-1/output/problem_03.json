  "method": "Convert NaOH volume to dm3: 23.40 cm3 = 0.02340 dm3. Then n(NaOH) = cV = 0.150 x 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol. From H2SO4 + 2NaOH, moles of acid are half the NaOH moles: n(H2SO4) = 0.00351/2 = 0.001755 mol. Acid volume is 25.00 cm3 = 0.02500 dm3, so c(H2SO4) = n/V = 0.001755/0.02500 = 0.0702 mol dm-3.",

    "Because 2 mol NaOH neutralize 1 mol H2SO4, acid moles must be smaller than base moles.",
