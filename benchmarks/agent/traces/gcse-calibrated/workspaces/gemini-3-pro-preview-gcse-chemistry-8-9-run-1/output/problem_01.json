  },
  "method": "We use the dilution formula c1V1 = c2V2 provided in L16. We are given the initial concentration c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3 and initial volume V1 = 25.0 cm3 in L29. The final volume V2 is 250.0 cm3, also from L29. Rearranging the equation for c2 gives c2 = (c1 * V1) / V2. Substituting the values: c2 = (0.200 * 25.0) / 250.0 = 5.0 / 250.0 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. The units of volume cancel out, leaving the concentration in mol dm-3.",
