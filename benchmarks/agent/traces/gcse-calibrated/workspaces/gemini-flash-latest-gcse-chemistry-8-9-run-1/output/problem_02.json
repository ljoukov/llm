  "method": "First, the mass of pure calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the sample is calculated using the given mass and purity percentage. Then, the moles of CaCO3 are determined using the molar mass Mr(CaCO3) = 100.1. The balanced chemical equation shows a 1:1 molar ratio between CaCO3 and CO2. Therefore, the moles of CO2 produced are equal to the moles of CaCO3 reacted. Finally, the mass of CO2 is calculated by multiplying the moles of CO2 by its molar mass Mr(CO2) = 44.0.",
  "key_equations": [
    "n = m / Mr",
    "Mass(CaCO3) = Sample Mass * Purity",
    "Mass(CO2) = n(CO2) * Mr(CO2)"

  "checks": [
    "Mass of pure CaCO3: 5.00 g * 0.840 = 4.20 g.",
    "Moles of CaCO3: 4.20 g / 100.1 g mol-1 = 0.041958 mol.",
    "Mass of CO2: 0.041958 mol * 44.0 g mol-1 = 1.846 g. The answer is reasonable as it is less than the mass of the pure reactant."
