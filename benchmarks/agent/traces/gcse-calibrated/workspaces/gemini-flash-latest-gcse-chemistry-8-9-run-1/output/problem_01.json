  "method": "The problem is solved using the dilution formula, c1V1 = c2V2, which assumes the moles of solute remain constant upon dilution. The initial concentration (c1 = 0.200 mol dm-3) and initial volume (V1 = 25.0 cm3) are multiplied to find the moles of HCl. This is then divided by the final volume (V2 = 250.0 cm3) to find the new concentration (c2). Since both volumes are in the same units (cm3), no unit conversion to dm3 is necessary for the ratio.",

    "The concentration decreases by a factor of 10, which matches the dilution factor (250.0 cm3 / 25.0 cm3 = 10).",
    "Moles of HCl: 0.200 mol dm-3 * (25.0/1000) dm3 = 0.00500 mol. Final concentration: 0.00500 mol / (250.0/1000) dm3 = 0.0200 mol dm-3. Calculation confirmed."
