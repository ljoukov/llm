  "method": "The mass of copper deposited is calculated in a three-step process. First, the total charge (Q) passed is calculated by multiplying the current (I) and the time (t) in seconds. Second, the moles of electrons (n(e-)) are determined by dividing the charge (Q) by the Faraday constant (F = 96,500 C mol-1). Third, the moles of copper (n(Cu)) are found using the half-equation, which shows that 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper. Finally, the mass of copper is calculated by multiplying the moles of copper by its atomic mass (Ar(Cu) = 63.55).",

  "checks": [
    "Time in seconds: 30.0 * 60 = 1800 s.",
    "Charge (Q): 1.50 A * 1800 s = 2700 C.",
    "Moles of electrons: 2700 / 96500 = 0.02798 mol.",
    "Mass of Cu: (0.02798 / 2) * 63.55 = 0.8899 g. The calculation is consistent."
