  "method": "The concentration of H2SO4 is found using a standard titration calculation. First, the moles of the known substance, NaOH, are calculated using its concentration and volume (converted to dm3). The balanced equation H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O establishes a 1:2 molar ratio between H2SO4 and NaOH. The moles of H2SO4 are therefore half the moles of NaOH. Finally, the concentration of H2SO4 is calculated by dividing its moles by the volume of H2SO4 used (converted to dm3).",

    "Moles NaOH: 0.150 * 0.02340 = 0.00351 mol.",
    "Moles H2SO4: 0.00351 / 2 = 0.001755 mol.",
    "Concentration H2SO4: 0.001755 mol / 0.02500 dm3 = 0.0702 mol dm-3. The concentration is lower than the NaOH, which is expected due to the 1:2 stoichiometry."
