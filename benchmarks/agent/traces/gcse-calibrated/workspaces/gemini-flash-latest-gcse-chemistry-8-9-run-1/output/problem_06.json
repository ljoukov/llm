  },
  "method": "The equilibrium constant (Kc) is calculated by first determining the equilibrium concentrations of the reactant (N2O4) and product (NO2). Concentration is found by dividing the moles of each species by the volume of the vessel (2.00 dm3). The equilibrium constant expression, Kc = [NO2]^2 / [N2O4], is then used to find the final value. The answer is reported as unitless as per the instructions.",

    "Concentration [NO2]: 0.180 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.0900 mol dm-3.",
    "Concentration [N2O4]: 0.220 mol / 2.00 dm3 = 0.110 mol dm-3.",
    "Kc: (0.0900)^2 / 0.110 = 0.00810 / 0.110 = 0.073636... The result is less than 1, indicating the equilibrium favors the reactant (N2O4)."
