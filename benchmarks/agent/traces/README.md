# Benchmark Traces

This folder contains committed, sanitized benchmark artifacts so model behavior is inspectable on GitHub.

- `latest/summary.json`: latest full benchmark summary
- `latest/report.md`: latest full benchmark report
- `latest/workspaces/<model-task-run>/...`: latest full benchmark workspaces/traces
- `gcse-calibrated/summary.json`: calibrated GCSE-focused run where Codex + Gemini 3 Pro pass and Flash fails
- `gcse-calibrated/report.md`: calibrated GCSE-focused report
- `gcse-calibrated/workspaces/<model-task-run>/...`: calibrated GCSE workspaces/traces
- `minimax-m2.1-tumor-vaccine-ici/summary.json`: single-model Fireworks minimax-m2.1 run on tumor-vaccine-ici
- `minimax-m2.1-tumor-vaccine-ici/report.md`: report for that run
- `minimax-m2.1-tumor-vaccine-ici/workspaces/<model-task-run>/...`: workspace/traces for that run

Sanitization and safety:
- absolute host paths are redacted or converted to relative workspace paths
- no `..` traversal is allowed in benchmark path policy
- traces include filesystem access logs and tool-call logs

Source run:
- generated by `benchmarks/agent/run.ts`
- raw runtime artifacts in `benchmarks/agent/results/` are gitignored
