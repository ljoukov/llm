# Benchmark Traces

This folder contains committed, sanitized benchmark artifacts so model behavior is inspectable on GitHub.

- `latest/summary.json`: run-level structured summary
- `latest/report.md`: human-readable report
- `latest/workspaces/<model-task-run>/...`: per-model workspace snapshots and traces

Sanitization and safety:
- absolute host paths are redacted or converted to relative workspace paths
- no `..` traversal is allowed in benchmark path policy
- traces include filesystem access logs and tool-call logs

Source run:
- generated by `benchmarks/agent/run.ts`
- raw runtime artifacts in `benchmarks/agent/results/` are gitignored
